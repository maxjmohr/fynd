The German Embassy has been closed since August 15, 2021.', 'terrorism': 'Serious attacks are repeatedly carried out in Kabul and other parts of the country, causing numerous deaths and injuries. Bombings, armed attacks and kidnappings have been part of everyday life in all parts of Afghanistan for years. This continues to apply after the Taliban effectively took power. Attacks are also directed against foreign nationals. The German Embassy Kabul has been closed since August 15, 2021. The Mazar-e Sharif Consulate General was closed at the end of May 2021. Local consular support is currently not possible. Please note the current travel warning and request to leave the country. If you travel to Afghanistan despite a travel warning and a request to leave the country, be aware of the risk. Be particularly careful in busy places and on special occasions. Please note the global safety notice.', 'Domestic political situation': 'The domestic political situation has fundamentally changed when the Taliban came to power in large parts of the country and especially in Kabul and the large cities. Although the hostilities have largely ended since the Taliban came to power, the overall security situation remains poor. There are reports of serious human rights violations and attacks by Taliban representatives, including against members of the existing security forces and government, but also against civilians. Many civil liberties that existed until the Taliban came to power, at least in the big cities, were severely restricted. In particular, numerous restrictions were imposed against women and girls (see the travel information section “Legal specifics”). Check out local media, including social media. Find out about the current security situation. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Avoid conflicts with local security forces.', 'crime': ""Assassinations, robberies, kidnappings (including of foreigners) and other violent crimes continue to occur across the country. There is also a high level of everyday crime and organized crime in the cities. German citizens have also already been affected. Throughout Afghanistan, including in the cities and the capital Kabul, Germans are at high risk of becoming victims of a kidnapping or violent crime. Criminal groups have declared foreigners the target of attacks and robberies. There are no completely safe places. Be particularly careful in large crowds, near Taliban-occupied buildings, schools, mosques, airports and bus stations, in markets and all other frequented places and be aware of your surroundings and your valuables. Under no circumstances should you spend the night in unsecured places. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself.""}","{'General information': 'Afghanistan is located in a very seismically active zone, so earthquakes occur regularly, which can result in aftershocks, landslides and floods. The climate is dry, continental with hot summers and cold winters. Continued precipitation of rain and snow can lead to avalanches, mudslides and slides of entire mountain slopes in vulnerable areas. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Familiarize yourself with what to do in the event of an earthquake. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.'}","{'Responsible foreign mission': 'The German Embassy Kabul has been closed since August 15, 2021. Local consular support is currently not possible.', 'Infrastructure/transport': ""The country's infrastructure has suffered significantly from the chaos of war; a large part of the road network has been destroyed. There is no rail transport. Kabul Airport's infrastructure and flight safety facilities do not meet international standards. Afghanistan has been the scene of military conflict for many years and is considered one of the countries at high risk from landmines. Hiking and overland journeys, especially off-road, can therefore be life-threatening. The safety situation on the route must be carefully clarified promptly before the journey. Do not go on hikes or cross-country trips. Only carry out absolutely necessary journeys in a convoy and, if possible, with professional accompaniment. Do not travel with Afghan airlines."", ""Driver's license"": 'The international driving license is required and is only valid in conjunction with the national German driving license.

Same-sex acts and transsexuality are criminalized under current Afghan law. There is no information available about the conduct of criminal proceedings for homosexual acts and transsexuality under the new de facto rulers. Heterosexual acts outside of marriage are also punishable under current Afghan law. (Note: There is no reliable information as to which legal provisions will be applied in practice under the new de facto rulers.) Please note the general information for LGBTIQ.', 'Legal specifics': 'The Taliban have decreed that women and girls must be accompanied by a male family member and must also cover their hair and face when outside the home. Close contact between men and women is illegal. After the de facto takeover of government by the Taliban, people who act as security forces for the de facto government cannot always be identified by their uniforms or similar. Afghan legislation applies to all persons residing in Afghanistan, regardless of their religion. Sales of alcohol/drugs and consumption of alcohol/drugs are prohibited and are punishable by law. Taking photographs of public facilities, military areas, airports, security vehicles, vehicles used by the Taliban, police officers and security forces is prohibited and can be considered a criminal offense of espionage and can be punished with at least correspondingly long prison sentences. The photography ban also applies to embassy buildings.', 'Money/credit cards': 'The national currency is the Afghani (AFN). Withdrawing cash from ATMs and paying with credit cards are only possible in isolated cases in Kabul. There are bottlenecks in the cash supply and withdrawal limits. The USD is accepted as a means of payment in many places.'}","{'General information': 'No legally binding information can be provided regarding entry and customs regulations. The information below refers to the rules in place until August 2021, which, to the knowledge of the Federal Foreign Office, will continue to be applied.

The passport should be stamped upon entry, especially if travelers are not traveling on a regular scheduled flight. Without an entry stamp, problems can arise when leaving the country again. A recent polio vaccination must be proven with a vaccination certificate, which must not be older than one year when leaving Afghanistan. This can be checked upon departure; Without proof of vaccination, leaving the country can be prohibited. The background is the occurrence of several cases of polio in Afghanistan, see Health. If the vaccination has taken place a long time ago, the traveler cannot get the disease themselves, but can still transmit it."", 'A view': 'German citizens need a visa to enter Afghanistan, which must be applied for before entry at an Afghan mission abroad such as the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.', 'Minors': 'There are no known special regulations for the entry of minors. If necessary, please note the instructions for a declaration of consent for minors.', 'Import regulations': 'Foreign currency can be imported without restrictions, but must be declared upon entry.

The import and export of local currency is limited to 500 AFN.'}","{'Vaccination protection': ""No compulsory vaccinations are required for direct entry from Germany. When entering from an area with cases of poliomyelitis (child paralysis), proof of a polio vaccination must be provided. When leaving Afghanistan, a polio vaccination is recommended by the WHO for people who have been in the country for more than four weeks, see Poliomyelitis. Ensure full vaccination protection against poliomyelitis (polio), see Poliomyelitis. Make sure that you and your children's standard vaccinations are up to date according to the Robert Koch Institute's vaccination calendar. Vaccinations against hepatitis A and polio are recommended as travel vaccinations, and for long-term stays or special exposure also against typhus, hepatitis B and rabies. Please note the application instructions and help for the indication in the travel vaccination recommendations. The DTG offers current, detailed travel vaccination recommendations for professionals."", 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. In Afghanistan, 95% of malaria is of the vivax type. In the eastern provinces bordering Pakistan below 2,500 m altitude, there is a high risk of malaria from May to November and a low risk from December to April. Below 2,500 m altitude, there is a low risk of malaria in the rest of the country, including Kabul, see DTG Standing Committee on Travel Medicine (StAR). To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. This also reduces the risk of rare diseases such as phlebotomous fever (transmitted by mosquitoes), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and relapsing fever (both transmitted by ticks). You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also make sense (not for short stays in Kabul and the military bases). Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is a general risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or needles) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Domestic and commercial wastewater is generally discharged untreated into surface water via open drains. These are therefore usually heavily contaminated with fecal germs and chemical pollutants. Diarrheal diseases are common throughout the country all year round. Tap water, even in cities, is by no means drinking water quality. The risk of infection with salmonella, shigella and typhus diseases, amoeba, lamblia and worm diseases exists nationwide, see diarrheal diseases. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Poliomyelitis (child paralysis)': 'Afghanistan is one of the few countries in the world where poliovirus infections are still being reported. Transmission occurs through fecally contaminated drinking water or food. If you are traveling for less than four weeks, make sure you are fully vaccinated against poliomyelitis. Booster vaccinations are necessary every ten years. If you are traveling and staying in the country for longer periods of more than four weeks, you should also be vaccinated against poliomyelitis with one dose four weeks to 12 months before you leave the country again. The vaccination must be certified separately in the international vaccination certificate. See also poliomyelitis.', 'rabies': 'Rabies is an infectious disease that is always fatal and is caused by viruses that are transmitted in the saliva of infected animals or people. There is a high risk of bites from stray dogs and the transmission of rabies across the country. The necessary medical measures after bite injuries to an unvaccinated person are generally not possible in Afghanistan. Vaccination before a bite offers reliable protection against the disease, see rabies. Avoid contact with stray animals. Get advice about a rabies vaccination and get vaccinated. Even if you have already been vaccinated, consult a doctor immediately after contact with a potentially infected animal or person (bite, licking of injured skin areas or droplets of saliva on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes).', 'Typhus': 'Typhus abdominalis is caused by bacteria (so-called salmonella). Typical initial symptoms are fever and headache. As the disease progresses, watery diarrhea or constipation, coughing and reddening of the skin can occur. The pathogens are absorbed through contaminated food and drinking water. In Afghanistan in recent years there have been repeated cases of typhoid fever that are difficult to treat due to antibiotic resistance. S. also typhus. Maintain good drinking water and food hygiene. Get advice about a typhoid vaccination and, if necessary, get vaccinated.', 'Leishmaniasis': 'In particular, cutaneous leishmaniasis (a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies with skin changes that usually only appear weeks to months after the bite) is widespread in rural areas. S. also leishmaniasis. Protect yourself adequately from sand flies as part of exposure prophylaxis. If skin ulcers do not heal after a stay in Afghanistan, see a doctor.', 'Tuberculosis': 'Tuberculosis is much more common nationwide than in Central Europe. Transmission occurs from person to person via droplet infection or close contact. The risk of resistant tuberculosis is particularly high due to improper or discontinued treatment. Wearing a surgical mask does not protect against infection.', 'Flu (Seasonal Influenza)': 'Seasonal influenza viruses, including influenza A/H1N1 (“swine flu”), circulate in Afghanistan during the winter months. Exact information on the number of cases is not known. Get advice about vaccination if you belong to the risk groups addressed by the Robert Koch Institute.', 'Geographically related diseases': 'Altitude sickness is a potentially very dangerous dysfunction of the lungs and brain caused by tactical errors in the necessary adjustment to altitude above 2,300 meters (e.g. by climbing too quickly and overexertion), see altitude sickness. Intense sunlight, glare from snow and ice, strong winds, extreme cold and impassable or unknown terrain pose additional risks for travelers at high altitudes. Earthquakes or persistent rainfall can cause avalanches, mudslides and entire mountain slopes to slide in vulnerable areas. Before traveling to high altitudes (above 2,300 meters), seek individual advice from a doctor experienced in high-altitude medicine before finalizing your travel plans. Travel health insurance that covers the risk of mountains (e.g. helicopter evacuation) is strongly recommended.', 'Air pollution': 'In the summer months there can be a high level of dust pollution in the air. Hot dust storms (“Shomal”) often occur, particularly in the western parts of the country. This can significantly worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma or COPD. The eyes should also be protected accordingly. Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual.', 'Medical care': 'Medical care is inadequate in large parts of the country, and emergency care with a functioning rescue chain is usually non-existent. In Kabul, too, medical care does not meet European standards. In the event of serious illness, medical evacuation, e.g. to Dubai, must be considered. The supply of reliable medication and an uninterrupted cold chain are often not guaranteed. It must be expected that counterfeit products will be sold instead of properly approved medicines, especially in small rural pharmacies. Numerous resistances to commonly used antibiotics are occurring across the country. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first-aid kit and a sufficient amount of regular medication with you to Afghanistan and protect them against high temperatures on the way. For entry, have your doctor certify that you need it in English. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG. In addition to the general exclusion of liability, please note: No guarantee can be given for the accuracy and completeness of the medical information or liability for any damage that may occur. All information depends on the individual travel conditions and does not replace medical consultation or in-depth medical advice. If applicable, information usually refers to direct entry from Germany into a travel country and is particularly tailored to longer stays on site. Deviations may apply for shorter trips and entries from third countries.'}"
1,EGY,Ägypten,"{'General information': 'A warning is issued against traveling to the north of the Sinai Peninsula, the Egyptian-Israeli border area (with the exception of Taba) and remote areas of the Sahara. Unaccompanied, individual excursions and overland trips in the south of the Sinai Peninsula are not recommended.', 'terrorism': 'There remains a risk of terrorist attacks across the country. In the past, these were mostly directed against Egyptian security authorities, sometimes against Coptic institutions and occasionally against foreign targets and citizens. Most recently, in 2019, a car bomb attack in the center of Cairo claimed at least 20 lives and injured numerous people. Even after the state of emergency is lifted in 2021, the security forces and the military have considerable powers to intervene in the fight against terrorism. Increased checks by security forces can be expected, especially at night. Use special caution when traveling to Egypt, including the Red Sea tourist areas. Avoid proximity to Coptic institutions during the holidays (e.g. Coptic Christmas on January 7th). Always be vigilant, especially in busy places and on special occasions. Please note the global safety notice. Sinai Peninsula A warning is issued against traveling to the north of the Sinai Peninsula, the North Sinai Governorate and the Egyptian-Israeli border area - with the exception of the immediate coastal section and the border town of Taba. Military operations are taking place in these regions as there have been terrorist attacks in the past. A state of emergency applies in the North Sinai Governorate, which is accompanied by nighttime curfews. The road from Suez to Taba is closed to non-military vehicles. Warnings are issued against traveling to the neighboring Gaza Strip; This applies in particular to people with family members in the Gaza Strip. Due to the current, confusing security situation, the Rafah border crossing between Egypt and the Gaza Strip will only be opened to a limited number of people at irregular intervals. The overland journey to Rafah is particularly dangerous. In the south of the Sinai Peninsula, the South Sinai Governorate with the coastal towns of Sharm el-Sheikh, Dahab, Nuweiba and Taba on the Red Sea, unaccompanied, individual excursions and overland trips are discouraged. Follow the instructions from hotels and tour operators. Only go on diving and snorkeling tours, mountain hikes and desert trips with licensed local company. Only book excursions with a licensed local escort. Other parts of the country We warn against traveling to remote areas of the Sahara, including the border areas with Libya and Sudan. The Egyptian authorities have declared the border regions with Libya and Sudan restricted areas and have banned travel there. The extent of the existing restricted areas is subject to constant change. Excursion destinations that are located in the remote western and southern desert areas can generally be visited with a special permit. The trip must take place with a travel provider recognized by the Ministry of Tourism. Desert excursions that have already been approved can also be banned at short notice by the military and security authorities. Only take part in desert excursions that are professionally organized and accompanied by local experts with recognized travel providers. Under no circumstances should you travel to excursion destinations beyond secured locations and road connections. Only undertake cross-country journeys with someone who knows the area.', 'Domestic political situation': 'Serious terrorist attacks on Egyptian security forces and civilian targets cannot be ruled out. Demonstrations cannot still be ruled out, especially in Cairo and other cities. In the course of combating terrorism, security forces and the military have considerable powers to intervene. Increased controls by security forces can be expected, especially at night and during demonstrations. Critical statements about Egypt and political comments, including on social media, can be viewed, among other things, as criminal insults and defamation of Egypt or the President or as criminal “spreading false news” and can result in criminal prosecution. During inspections, a search for such comments is possible. Recently, there have been increased checks on people in public spaces, especially in Cairo, including by plainclothes police officers and searches of mobile phones, among other things. Refusals to comply with (civilian) police requests can result in at least short-term restrictions on freedom or arrests. Be vigilant and inform yourself through local media or your tour operator. Please note the information provided by hotels and tour operators. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people, such as areas in front of mosques after Friday. Unofficially\xa0approved demonstrations and protests are prohibited and participation in these may result in criminal prosecution. Be sure to avoid religious sites, universities and government institutions, especially on days such as the anniversary of the overthrow of former President Mubarak on January 25th or the revolution anniversary on June 30th. Be conscious of your behavior and statements in public and on social media.', 'Mine danger': 'Minefields are often inadequately marked, particularly in the Sinai, in some undeveloped coastal areas of the Red Sea, on the undeveloped Mediterranean coastal strip west of El Alamein and in regions bordering Sudan and Libya. Use caution in the areas mentioned and stay on regular roads and paths. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities.', 'crime': ""The crime rate in Egypt is comparatively low. Petty crimes such as pickpocketing and isolated attacks, especially on women, occur. In holiday areas such as Hurghada, fraudulent or extortionate behavior can sometimes be observed among taxi drivers. Exercise normal caution and be particularly careful when traveling alone, including as the last passenger in shared taxis. Especially if you are a woman traveling alone, avoid walking in big cities and outside tourist areas after dark. If you only use taxis with the taxi meter switched on, pay through the window after getting out. Find out more before you start your journey, e.g. B. in your hotel about the destination and the approximate price of the trip. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports, train stations and on buses and look after your valuables. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'Egypt is located in a seismically active zone, which is why earthquakes can occur. The climate ranges from Mediterranean on the Mediterranean coast and in the Nile Delta to desert in Cairo, Middle and Upper Egypt. In rare cases, fatal incidents involving sharks can occur. Most recently, a person was killed by a shark near the beach in Hurghada in June 2023; Two similar incidents occurred in the summer of 2022. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Check with your hotel or tour operator about wildlife threats and follow the news. Familiarize yourself with what to do in the event of an earthquake. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'There is a domestic flight network, limited rail traffic and a fairly well-developed road network on main routes. The security checks at Egyptian airports are sometimes inadequate. The Egyptian rail network is partly outdated. Serious accidents with fatalities occur again and again. Short-term train cancellations are to be expected, particularly on secondary routes. Special tariffs and, if necessary, further restrictions apply to foreigners. The safety standards on ferries, such as those used to travel across the Red Sea, do not always meet international standards. Accidents involving tourist boats and diving boats or ships have increased recently. In many places there are shared buses and special taxis that can be rented locally. The driving style of vehicle drivers is often extremely risky and the risk of accidents is very high. Accidents due to the poor condition of vehicles, devices and equipment such as hot air balloons, diving equipment and quads happen relatively often. Most of the roads of tourist interest are tarred; an off-road vehicle with four-wheel drive is required for desert roads. There are currently access restrictions for off-road vehicles in the Sinai area (access to the Suez Tunnel). To enter the country with your own vehicle, a “Carnet de Passage” and local personal liability insurance are required. In addition, a deposit is often required, which is not always fully refunded. Since Egyptian vehicles often only have minimal insurance for personal injury, additional comprehensive insurance should definitely be taken out. Usual traffic law principles and regulations receive little attention. The technical condition and especially the lighting of vehicles are often inadequate. The 0.0 alcohol limit applies. When traveling individually with your own vehicle - which is currently largely discouraged due to the above-mentioned information - it should be noted that the supply of fuel (especially diesel) is not fully guaranteed in all areas of Egypt. Please note the existing partial travel warning. Be particularly careful in traffic, even as a pedestrian. When renting equipment and vehicles, make sure they are in technical condition and maintained. Avoid driving at night. Avoid overland rail journeys as much as possible. Please note that when purchasing train tickets for foreigners, special tariffs apply, which must generally be paid in foreign currency (USD, EUR). Not every train connection can be booked by foreigners.', ""Driver's license"": 'The international driving license is required and is only valid in conjunction with the national German driving license.', 'LGBTIQ': 'Homosexual acts are not explicitly punished in Egypt. However, there are broad criminal offenses to protect morals or religion, under which homosexuality can also be punished - especially if it is openly shown. The Egyptian penal code criminalizes “debauchery”. Although homosexuality is not explicitly mentioned, law enforcement authorities and courts rely on the relevant article and a 1961 law to combat prostitution. Both fines and prison sentences are envisaged in this context. However, no case has yet been reported in which a foreign tourist has actually been prosecuted under these general provisions. However, arrests and subsequent deportations of foreigners have already occurred. Human rights organizations report that Egyptian authorities are also using dating apps to locate LGBTIQ people. It cannot be ruled out that foreign tourists could also fall victim to this approach. In individual cases, transgender travelers reported controls and difficulties upon entry, including refusal of entry, especially if the name or photo on the passport did not correspond to their gender identity. Please also note the general information for LGBTIQ.', 'Legal specifics': 'Even minor drug offenses are punished with harsh penalties (prison up to the death penalty in particularly serious cases). Unlike in Germany, prostitution and adultery are punishable in Egypt. Photographing and filming military and police facilities, vehicles and personnel without appropriate authorization is not permitted; the same applies to prisons or prison administration buildings. Violations could result in confiscation of the photo/film camera and arrest. The import and use of drones and certain other devices without special authorization from the Egyptian authorities can lead to the confiscation of the drones or devices and to arrests and prosecution, see in detail under Entry and Customs Import Regulations. Particular caution should be exercised when making critical statements about Egypt and political comments on social media. These can be prosecuted, among other things, as criminal insults and defamation of Egypt and its institutions (e.g. the president and security forces) or as criminal “spreading false news”. Unofficially sanctioned demonstrations and protests are prohibited; participation in these may result in criminal prosecution.', 'Money/credit cards': 'The local currency is the Egyptian pound (EGP).

The Egyptian Tourism Authority provides information about the current import limits. In Egypt, as in many other countries, there is a strict export ban for, among other things, all antique objects as well as for a large number of plants and animals that are under nature and species protection (e.g. corals, shells, petrified wood), even if they appear to have been purchased legally. The re-export of Egyptian antiquities brought by foreigners entering Egypt is also not permitted, even if these items were acquired legally in the country of origin and proof of this can be provided. The import of drones without prior authorization from the Egyptian Civil Aviation Authority is prohibited. If detected by customs during entry controls, the drones will be confiscated and arrests and prosecution may result, see also special criminal law provisions. The import of diving and snorkeling robots, walkie-talkies and certain GPS-enabled devices (except personal smartphones) can also lead to problems upon entry without the appropriate permits, including the confiscation of the devices in question and criminal prosecution.

Most of the Civil War-era landmines have now been cleared. However, the danger from mines remains in some parts of the country outside of major cities. Caution is therefore advised when driving off-road. Inquiries should be made about risks on specific travel routes. HALO Trust has overviews of the mines recorded. There are still smaller secessionist movements in Cabinda province. The security situation has improved, but remains tense due to spontaneous demonstrations and the economic and social situation. In the provinces of Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul, the situation in the diamond areas remains uncertain. In 2021 there were violent clashes between demonstrators and police forces. If possible, avoid traveling to Cabinda and the diamond areas of the Lunda Norte and Lunda Sul provinces. Find out about local media. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces.', 'crime': ""The crime rate is high. There is usually an increase in crime in the months of November to January, particularly in robberies and thefts. Armed attacks and thefts occur primarily in Luanda, but also in the rest of the country. These take place at any time of the day or night, even in busy environments such as in and around shopping centers, restaurants and hotels. In Luanda in particular, robberies are carried out on vehicles that have no way of escaping in stationary traffic. The attacks are sometimes initiated through diversionary tactics, such as simulating or deliberately provoking an accident or with water bottles stuck between the tires and the body. Regardless of the time of day, these attacks are predominantly carried out by armed perpetrators on motor scooters. Foreigners are prime targets for thefts and robberies. The perpetrators are not only after cash, but also credit cards and cell phones. If you are attacked, do not defend yourself as the perpetrators could be armed. If possible, avoid walking, especially after dark, even on the Marginal Promenade. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables and, if possible, avoid taking your credit card with you. Avoid wearing jewelry and watches openly. Don't choose ATMs on the street, but rather in shopping centers, supermarkets or banks and never let strangers watch you or help you. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as airports, train stations and markets and look after your valuables. Avoid participating in demonstrations. Be particularly careful when using your cell phone in public. While driving, pay particular attention to approaching scooters. You should never leave handbags, cameras, cell phones, etc. visible in the car. Avoid using public transport. Use taxi apps instead (two apps work with geolocation). Never leave drinks unattended and check prices before ordering. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'On the coast and in the north of the country it is tropical, in the highlands and in the south it is temperate-tropical, and in the southeast it is hot and dry. In Angola, the rainy season begins in September in the north, in the south around the end of November and lasts until April. Intense rainfall and flooding are expected during this time. Follow weather reports regularly during the rainy season. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'There are domestic flights and bus connections as well as a few railway connections in the country. Domestic flights and rail journeys involve risks due to irregular maintenance. The number of buses is relatively small. They run irregularly, are often very crowded and the routes are difficult for visitors to follow. Regular taxis have limited availability and are usually expensive. An alternative to this is to use a taxi app, e.g. from Yango, Heetch or T\'Leva. “Informal” taxis and minibuses, so-called candongueiros, are not suitable if you lack local and language knowledge. The road network is being further expanded. The majority of provincial capitals can now be reached via paved highways. During the rainy season, many roads become impassable, especially in the eastern, northern and southern parts of the country. Overland journeys bring with them an increased risk of accidents due to the poor condition of the vehicles and roads (potholes) as well as the sometimes careless driving style of other road users or those impaired by alcohol and high traffic volumes. Medical and vehicle technical care outside Luanda is severely limited, and there is sometimes no mobile phone connection outside of the cities. Vehicle inspections by the police are often used to impose fines for alleged rule violations. Make sure to be picked up at the airport upon arrival and accompanied by local people. If you are a short-term visitor, avoid driving yourself if possible. If possible, travel outside Luanda in a convoy (at least two vehicles). Avoid cross-country travel after dark.

The proportion of malaria tropica (P. falciparum) is over 99%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market.

A characteristic of these viral infections (yellow fever, Ebola and Marburg viruses, etc.) is high fever, a pronounced feeling of illness and a tendency to bleed. The diseases are associated with a high death rate. For all hemorrhagic fevers (except yellow fever), unprotected contact with sick people, especially their body fluids, poses a high risk. Get vaccinated against yellow fever. Avoid sick people and their body fluids. Avoid bat caves and other gatherings of these animals. Avoid contact with raw game meat, especially monkeys (“bush meat”). Avoid slaughterhouses or other animal slaughterhouses and contact with animal blood. Use skin repellents against mosquitoes and ticks, even during the day.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a high risk of malaria tropica ( P. falciparum ), which occurs almost exclusively throughout the year and throughout the country. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them.

However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food.

The damage to civil infrastructure is significant. There is a risk of mines and booby traps and, in some cases, a risk of unexploded bombs. Driving or entering these districts without permission from the Azerbaijani authorities is prohibited for security reasons. Violators will be prosecuted. The danger of mines and explosives applies equally to the Azerbaijan-Armenia national border, including the border between the Azerbaijan Autonomous Republic of Nakhichevan and Armenia.

Entry into the parts of Nagorno-Karabakh that are still not controlled by Azerbaijan (areas north and west of Shusha, Lachin corridor) is prohibited by the Azerbaijani government; Entry without a corresponding Azerbaijani permit continues to be a criminal offense under Azerbaijani law and leads to refusal of entry into Azerbaijan, see also legal special features. These areas are currently controlled by Russian troops; these also authorize the crossing of the demarcation line to these territories.

This also applies to holders of service or diplomatic passports. Visa before entry The visa can be obtained before the start of the trip at the Ethiopian embassy in Berlin or as an e-visa; However, the e-visa process is sometimes prone to errors. E-visa holders should definitely carry a printout of the visa and proof of fee payment with them, otherwise the fee may have to be paid again at the airport. The e-visa only entitles you to enter the country via Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. The exact entry requirements and current visa fees can be obtained from the responsible Ethiopian diplomatic mission. Visa on arrival The Ethiopian authorities announced in mid-October 2023 that nationals of certain countries, including Germany, can again obtain visas on arrival at the airport for tourist trips (see current news). The conditions for the grant and the amount of the fee have not yet been announced. If you would like to use the “Visa on arrival”, make sure in advance that the airline you have chosen will allow you to travel without a pre-issued visa. Entry control If the border authorities suspect that foreigners want to enter the country for a purpose that does not correspond to the purpose of their stay stated in the visa, entry will be refused and the passport will be retained until departure. Collection of biometric data When leaving and entering the country, travelers are photographed as part of passport control and - except for diplomats - their fingerprints are scanned. Refusal to cooperate may result in a refusal to leave or enter the country. Transit to other East African countries Visa-free entry for up to 24 hours may be possible with an Ethiopian Airlines ticket; The airline will provide information on this. Extension of stay Visa extensions must be applied for well before the expiry of the visa at the main office of the Ethiopian Immigration Authority in Addis Ababa. If you plan to extend your stay, you should bring a sufficient amount of USD with you, as foreign currency is practically unavailable in Ethiopia and the fee can only be paid in USD. There is no guarantee for an extension. If you exceed the length of stay, you will be subject to a high fine, which can also only be paid in USD. In addition, a prison sentence can also be ordered in individual cases. Passport loss Travelers whose passport is stolen or otherwise lost during their stay in Ethiopia must report this loss to the responsible Ethiopian police station. You will receive a certificate of loss there. This means that a travel document as a replacement passport or a temporary passport can then be applied for and issued at the German Embassy in Addis Ababa. An exit visa must then be applied for at the Ethiopian immigration authority in Addis Ababa (Department for Immigration and Nationality Affairs) by presenting the police certificate of loss; Without this it is not possible to leave the country. The process is cumbersome and usually takes several working days. The fee for this is between $50 and $75 per person. Fee increases are possible at any time.

Foreigners who are only temporarily staying in Ethiopia are required to declare imported foreign currency worth more than USD 10,000 (or equivalent in other foreign currency) upon entry and are allowed to keep it in their possession for as long as their visa is valid. When entering the country by land, foreign currency amounts of 500 USD must be declared. The following applies when leaving the country: If foreign currency is exported in excess of the amount that does not require declaration upon import, those affected must prove the origin of the money by presenting the import declaration or the exchange receipt from a licensed agency. In the event of violations, the amount of money involved may be confiscated and fines and prison sentences may be imposed.

Certain items (including binoculars, telephoto lenses, drones, and communication devices such as walkie-talkies and satellite phones) are not allowed to be imported and will be confiscated by customs upon entry. When importing video camera equipment (depending on the type and brand of camera), complications and even confiscation can occur, especially if it is professional equipment. Despite issuing a receipt and an assurance that they will be returned upon departure, there are many reports that confiscated items can no longer be found. Other items may also be affected. Therefore, it is strongly advised not to take the aforementioned items and other valuable items with you when traveling to Ethiopia. Valuable electronic devices, the import of which is permitted after registration with customs, will be entered into the passport upon entry. When you leave the country, it is checked whether these devices are actually being exported again.

The importation and possession of any kind of pornographic material is prohibited. No objects that have art historical value may be exported from Ethiopia without the permission of the National Museum (this applies to older objects over 50 years old, but also partly to newer woodwork, Bibles, icons, crosses, etc.). In order to avoid problems during export, in cases of doubt, approval from the National Museum should always be obtained sufficiently in advance before leaving the country. Problems can arise when exporting stones, plants, spices or parts of plants and animal products (leather, feathers, etc.). For the export of tea and coffee in luggage, the maximum quantity per person is 2 kg; Quantities exceeding this may be confiscated. Larger quantities can also be purchased in the duty-free area of \u200b\u200bthe airport.

If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a low risk of malaria in Addis Ababa and at altitudes above 2,500 m. In the other parts of the country below 2,500 m, there is a high risk of transmission all year round, including the city of Lalibela. The proportion of malaria tropica (P. alciparum) and mixed infections is 66%, malaria tertiana cases (P. vivax) account for 18%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. In addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) is also useful. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market.

Australia regularly experiences strong thunderstorms and downpours. Tropical cyclones can occur from November to April, particularly in the northern coastal areas of Queensland, the Northern Territory and Western Australia, bringing destructive hurricane-force winds and heavy rain. But heavy rain is also possible all year round in all other states. As a result, rivers overflowing their banks, widespread flooding (in cities also due to overloaded stormwater drainage channels) and landslides, as well as sometimes significant disruptions to travel traffic, regularly occur. Travel to affected areas should be avoided, the media closely monitored and the instructions of local authorities should be followed. Bush and forest fires Bush and forest fires occur regularly during the hot months of the Australian summer. Combined with strong winds, they can reach threatening proportions. The south and east of the country are particularly affected. There is no danger for travelers as long as safety instructions from the police and fire brigade are followed. The situation in the national parks is monitored by state rangers. They can be reached via the respective tourism offices and can provide information about possible dangerous situations.

Depending on the state, there is a speed limit of 50-60 km/h within towns and 100-110 km/h outside towns. Violations are punished with high fines. Overland journeys involve a certain risk of accidents, which is often underestimated. Particularly because of the very low traffic volume, fatigue, lack of concentration or distraction can lead to serious traffic accidents. Wild animals that suddenly appear, such as kangaroos, and their distances from your own vehicle can also be underestimated. Vehicle occupants often succumb to their serious injuries at the scene of the accident, as paramedics in remote areas reach the scene of the accident, for example. Sometimes only reached after hours. In Australia, statutory liability insurance (green slip) only provides for compensation for personal injuries (deaths and injuries) to third parties. Property damage - e.g. B. also on the opposing vehicle - are not covered. Personal injury to the driver who caused the accident is not automatically included; The services of the different providers vary considerably. If necessary, additional liability and/or comprehensive insurance must be taken out to cover personal injuries to the driver who caused the accident, as well as for all property damage and theft. Legal disputes in traffic accidents are usually very time-consuming and costly. In parts of Australia there are restrictions on the use of drinking water due to a lack of rainfall. So far there have been no drastic effects for travelers. Research Australian traffic rules carefully. Plan enough time for your trips and don't underestimate the long distances; take enough breaks.

Diseases in humans are rare, but are often severe and cause permanent damage or are fatal. There are no effective medications against the JE viruses. To avoid Japanese encephalitis, protect yourself consistently against mosquito bites as part of exposure prophylaxis, especially at dusk and at night, and get vaccinated when staying on the islands of the Torres Strait or the states of New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. if there is an increased individual risk due to a longer stay in the transmission areas and during the seasonal transmission periods.', 'Snakes, spiders, jellyfish and other animals': 'Illnesses and injuries can occur due to unwanted contact with snakes, spiders, jellyfish and other marine animals, as well as occasionally crocodiles and sharks. Follow warnings and seek medical help quickly if necessary. The seasonal, football-sized jellyfish “sea wasp” is one of the most dangerous marine animals in Australia. It occurs mainly from October to June on flat sandy beaches on the northern Australian coast between Broome in Western Australia (NW) and Gladstone in Queensland (NE). Contact with the tentacles, which are up to three meters long, can cause severe cardiotoxic symptoms, including respiratory arrest and heart failure, within just a few minutes. The “Irukandji” jellyfish, which is only a few centimeters long, and, more recently, the “Portuguese galley” are also found on the northern and eastern coasts of Australia. After netting, undramatic skin symptoms initially appear. Then after about 30 minutes, severe pain follows, but sometimes serious cardiovascular symptoms also occur. If jellyfish are injured, all tentacles sticking to the skin should be removed immediately and the affected areas should be doused with sea water or wine vinegar or covered with shaving foam. If the skin irritation does not subside after a few hours, see a doctor.', 'Leptospirosis': 'Leptospires are bacteria that are usually transmitted through contact with contaminated surface water.

The infection mainly occurs through skin injuries or inhalation of bacteria from the soil or virus-containing water droplets.

Carefully clean and disinfect skin wounds and cover them. Inform your doctor about your stay in (Northern) Australia and, if you have any symptoms, point out the suspected diagnosis of melioidosis.', 'Medical care': 'The state of the Australian healthcare system is generally good. However, waiting times for treatment may also have to be expected in emergencies. Private clinics generally do not have emergency departments. Medicines brought from Germany must be declared upon arrival. In principle, a prescription from the treating doctor must be available in English. The medication must be imported in accompanied luggage and in the original packaging; without special authorization, a requirement of three months may not be exceeded.

Extension of stay It is possible to obtain a visa through the local passport authority General Directorate of Nationality, Passports &amp; Residence can be extended for a fee. Further extensions are generally possible for a fee. The extension requires the approval of a local sponsor (hotel confirmations are accepted, among other things).

Occasionally the passport is retained by employers for the duration of the stay. Refusal to leave the country/“Travel Ban” If people requiring a visa are staying in Bahrain without a valid residence permit, they will usually initially be refused exit. Before issuing an exit permit, the immigration authority imposes a fine, the amount of which is at the discretion of the judge and depends on the period of unauthorized stay. High fines are to be expected. In individual cases it has happened in member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council that German nationals resident there were prevented from leaving the country. A common reason is disagreements about employment law, which cause the employer (“sponsor”) to ask the responsible authorities to impose residence measures in the sense of a “travel ban”, even outside of court proceedings. In the past, the employee\'s failure to fulfill financial demands has also led to his being refused permission to leave the country.

Travel vaccinations: Vaccinations against hepatitis A and poliomyelitis are recommended. Depending on individual indications, additional vaccinations against dengue fever, hepatitis B, meningococcal ACWY, rabies and typhus are recommended. A cholera vaccination is usually not necessary. Standard vaccinations: Make sure that you and your children have the latest standard vaccinations according to the RKI vaccination calendar. Due to repeated outbreaks, adequate vaccination protection against measles in particular should be ensured.', 'Medical care': 'The medical care in Benin is not comparable to the care in Germany. Outside the large centers, there is a lack of trained medical professionals in many places. Planned operations, procedures and diagnostics should be carried out in Europe. Emergency and basic care is provided in large state hospitals and many private clinics. The pharmacies have a sufficient range of important standard medications. Counterfeit medications with unsafe contents occur. Get travel medical advice early on and adjust your vaccination protection. Relevant travel medicine practices and vaccination centers can be found via the DTG, among others. Take a first-aid kit and any medications you take regularly with you. If necessary, obtain a medical certificate in English that is necessary for entry.

There is a high risk of infection for both diseases all year round throughout the country, including the cities. The proportion of the dangerous malaria tropica ( P. falciparum ) is over 99%. The DTG provides a map of malaria risk areas. In addition, there are the following mosquito-borne diseases that can occur throughout the year: chikungunya fever, dengue fever and lymphatic filariasis. It can be assumed that leishmaniasis, West Nile fever and Zika virus infections also occur. Protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites throughout the day. Use mosquito repellent regularly and wear appropriate clothing. Use bed nets at night, see Protection from insects. A vaccination against yellow fever is mandatory. There is a vaccination against dengue fever; Get advice about your personal risk. To prevent malaria, it is advisable to take tablets in addition to mosquito repellent in areas with a high risk of malaria. Please seek medical advice regarding the selection of appropriate medications. The disease Crimean-Congo fever, which occurs in Benin, is transmitted by ticks. Tsetse flies are carriers of African sleeping sickness. Protect yourself from ticks and tsetse flies, especially when spending time outdoors. Check your body carefully after spending time outdoors, see Protecting yourself from insects.', 'Illnesses related to poor hygiene': ""In particular, poor drinking water, food and hand hygiene can lead to illnesses that are often accompanied by diarrhea. Undetermined traveler's diarrhea often occurs. Cholera, on the other hand, almost never affects travelers. Certain viral diseases of the liver (viral hepatitis A and E), shigellosis and typhus also occur in travelers. Poliomyelitis (cVDPV2) has been detected in Benin. Please note our basic hygiene instructions. Get advice about a typhoid vaccination. Ensure full vaccination protection against poliomyelitis. For stays longer than 4 weeks, according to WHO guidelines, a vaccination 4 weeks to 12 months before leaving the affected country. For a stay of less than 4 weeks, a booster vaccination if the last vaccination was administered more than 10 years ago, see poliomyelitis vaccination.

Always stay away from people who appear sick. Do not attend funerals or hospitals. Heed local warnings. Seek medical advice regarding a meningococcal ACWY vaccination. In addition to classic sexually transmitted diseases such as syphillis or gonorrhea, diseases such as AIDS or certain liver diseases (viral hepatitis B, C and D) can be transmitted through sexual contact in Benin. In principle, transmission is also possible through drug use with unclean syringes or cannulas, tattoos and blood transfusions. Always use condoms, especially with casual acquaintances. Get medical advice about a hepatitis B vaccination.', 'Diseases transmitted through animal contact': 'Hantavirus infections and leptospirosis are transmitted through contact with infectious rodent excretions. Lassa fever can also be transmitted through contact with bush meat. Infection with rabies occurs through dogs, monkeys and flying foxes and plays a special role due to the proximity of these animals to people. Bird flu can be transmitted through contact with birds and poultry. Poisonous snakes are particularly common in rural areas. Always avoid contact with animals and their excrement. If you are bitten by a dog, monkey, flying fox or poisonous snake, seek medical attention immediately. Antivenoms are only available to a limited extent in Benin. Avoid contact with stagnant or slow-moving water, as these may be contaminated with rodent urine. Avoid eating meat dishes of unclear origin. Get advice about a rabies vaccination. Please note that rabies vaccines and immunoglobulins are not available in the country or are only available to a very limited extent.', 'Other health risks': 'Schistosomiasis is a worm disease that can be transmitted even through minimal contact with fresh water. Schistosoma can also be transmitted in running water. Avoid bathing or swimming in inland waters. Air pollution can cause health problems, especially in large cities. There is a continuous pollution caused by waste incineration. During the harmattan season, air pollution occurs particularly in the first quarter of the year. Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual. Intense sun exposure can cause short- and long-term skin and eye damage. For example, find out about necessary sun protection measures using the SunSmart app. Traveling to the sea can be associated with particular dangers. Beaches contaminated by animal feces pose a risk of infection with parasitic skin diseases such as worm infections. Heed warnings from local authorities. Avoid beaches that are also used by animals.

There is a risk of infection in the southern parts of Bhutan, below 2,300 m altitude, close to the Indian border. Main transmission occurs during and after the rainy season in the months of July to September. The tourist preferred areas in the higher elevations are dengue-free. The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches and is increasingly affecting travelers. In rare cases, serious complications, including possible death, occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see dengue fever. Get advice from tropical and/or travel doctors regarding vaccination. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. In Bhutan, in the south at altitudes below 1,700 m (border regions with India), there is a low risk of transmission of malaria diseases all year round. Paro, Thimphu and altitudes above 1,700 m are considered malaria-free. Overall, very few cases of malaria are reported. DTG provides country information. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases can be prevented through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Japanese encephalitis': 'Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an inflammation of the brain caused by viruses. These are transmitted by nocturnal mosquitoes. Pigs and waterfowl in particular are infected with the virus without becoming ill themselves. Diseases in humans are rare, but are often severe and often leave lasting damage or are fatal. There are no effective medications against the JE viruses, see also Japanese encephalitis. In Bhutan, there is a risk of infection in the low-lying rural areas near the border with India; the main transmission period is June to December. To avoid Japanese encephalitis, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis and get vaccinated.', 'rabies': 'Rabies is a regularly fatal infectious disease that is caused by viruses that are transmitted in the saliva of infected animals or people (through bites, licking of injured skin areas or droplets of saliva on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes). There is a risk of stray dog \u200b\u200bbites and rabies transmission across the country, particularly in areas near the Indian border. The necessary medical measures after a bite from an unvaccinated person are not always possible in Bhutan. Vaccination before a bite offers reliable protection against the disease. This is why a preventive rabies vaccination is particularly important when traveling to Bhutan. It should definitely be completed before you travel. The immediate “refresher” that is still necessary even after a bite can then possibly take place in Thimphu or in the neighboring country of India. S. Rabies.', 'Tuberculosis': 'Tuberculosis is much more common nationwide than in Central Europe. The incidence is still well over 100 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Transmission occurs from person to person via droplet infection or close contact. Due to improper or discontinued treatment, resistant tuberculosis pathogens may also exist in Bhutan. Wearing a surgical mask does not protect against infection!', 'Geographically related diseases': 'Bhutan is a popular destination for trekking tourists who climb to high altitudes. There is often not enough time for gradual height adjustment. Various forms of acute altitude sickness are possible, see altitude sickness. Before traveling to high altitudes (above 2,300 m), seek individual advice from a doctor experienced in high-altitude medicine before finalizing your travel plans. Travel health insurance that covers the risk of mountains (e.g. helicopter evacuation) is strongly recommended. Intense sunlight, glare from snow and ice, strong winds, extreme cold and impassable or unknown terrain pose additional risks for travelers at high altitudes. Earthquakes or persistent rainfall can cause avalanches, mudslides and entire mountain slopes to slide in vulnerable areas.', 'Medical care': 'Medical care is inadequate in large parts of the country and usually does not meet European standards in terms of medical, hygiene, technology and organization. Language barriers can make communication significantly more difficult, especially in rural areas. Adequate basic services exist in Thimphu. In the event of serious illness, medical evacuation, for example to New Delhi, Calcutta or Bangkok, must be considered. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go. Before you travel, get personal advice from tropical medicine advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors via DTG, for example.

Do not try to break through roadblocks on your own. Plan your stay according to the current situation. Take additional food, drink, warm clothing and necessary medication with you.', 'crime': ""The security situation in Bolivia is comparatively good and violent attacks on tourists are rare. Nevertheless, crimes (such as trick thefts or, in individual cases, armed robberies) still occur, especially in places frequented by tourists. Particular caution should be exercised in El Alto and certain areas of La Paz, Santa Cruz and the Chapare region. This also applies to Los Yungas and generally when traveling to remote areas. Particular caution is advised in border areas of Bolivia due to violent drug and smuggling gangs. This applies especially to the border area with Brazil. It has already happened that travelers, for example when arriving at the bus station in La Paz or the airport in El Alto, were driven to remote parts of the city by fake taxi drivers. There they were robbed with the help of fake police officers in uniform on the pretext of wanting to carry out an anti-drug check and, under the threat of violence, forced to hand over their credit cards and PIN numbers. Blitz or express kidnappings with the same goal occur nationwide, but particularly in Cochabamba, La Paz and Santa Cruz and on the connecting routes. In collaboration with other criminals who pretend to be South American tourists, for example, fake police check IDs and/or take them to another location under a pretext in order to rob them there. Personal checks on the street or in open spaces generally do not occur. Taxis on the street pose an increased risk of being robbed, especially at night. Displaying sums of cash, identification documents, jewelry and expensive technical equipment in public unnecessarily attracts the attention of criminals. Vehicles are also broken into and stolen. Visitors to bars and discos are given knockout drops in order to then rob them. Cases of rape while the victims were unconscious have also been reported. Drug-related crime is widespread and travelers are sometimes used as drug couriers against their will and in ignorance. When investing, for example, in land, real estate, etc. As with all major investments, caution is always advised. Legal advice should be sought before concluding a contract. Do not wear expensive jewelry and watches. Do not show expensive technical devices and cell phones in public. Be particularly vigilant in large crowds such as airports and bus stations and look after your valuables. Always let the police show you your ID card. Do not hail taxis on the street, but rather order so-called radio taxis, which can be recognized by the illuminated sign on the roof with the company's name and telephone number, if necessary with the help of the hotel or restaurant. Avoid driving at night, especially because of the increased risk of accidents. As a general rule, do not accept open drinks or food offered by strangers. Do not leave drinks or food unattended. Stay away from drugs. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Always keep vehicles locked, do not leave any valuables visible and park in guarded parking spaces. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Be particularly careful about lure offers, for example over the Internet, to take a trip at someone else's expense. Do not take luggage for strangers and check the contents of your own luggage. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'The climate ranges from high mountain climate in the Andes to subtropical climate in Los Yungas to tropical climate in Beni and the dry zone in Chaco. During the rainy season, which usually lasts from November to April, floods and landslides occur regularly, especially in mountainous regions. Roads often become impassable for several days and bridges are often damaged. In recent years, persistent rains have claimed several lives. The large salt lake of Uyuni also poses significant risks of getting lost or stuck, not only but especially in the rainy season. The effects of earthquakes, which usually have their epicenter in Chile or Peru, are occasionally felt in different parts of Bolivia with varying degrees of intensity. Forest fires occur occasionally, especially in the months of June to September.

In the event of a storm warning, follow the instructions from the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'Air traffic in Bolivia is occasionally affected by short-term flight cancellations and significant delays. The bus network is well developed and cheap. As with all overland journeys, there is a risk that blockades or protests will result in longer, almost unforeseeable waiting times. The railway network, which only covers a small part of the country, is only partially suitable for traveling over longer distances. The country is poorly developed in terms of transport. There are only asphalted country roads on main traffic routes. All other connecting routes (gravel roads, scree and dirt roads; a few bridges) are often impassable for days during the rainy season (November to April). In Bolivia there have been repeated serious bus accidents resulting in fatalities. Overland travel by bus should be undertaken with well-known bus companies and night journeys should be avoided. Due to the particularly dangerous situation, cross-country journeys in cars in the dark are not recommended. The streets are generally not lit and are often in poor condition. Many road users, often including buses, drive without lights or with insufficient lighting. When renting a car for cross-country journeys, it is advisable to rent a car with a driver - also with a view to dealing with traffic accidents. This is particularly true when traveling off the main routes, as orientation can be extremely difficult in remote areas without paved roads and inadequate signage. Even commercially available navigation systems and maps often do not offer sufficient security. Without a driver who knows the area, dangers (e.g. during the rainy season, on the Salar de Uyuni, etc.) are difficult to assess. There is a legal regulation that requires vehicles with foreign license plates to pay higher prices for gasoline than vehicles with Bolivian license plates. In practice, this means that many gas stations do not know how to charge these prices and therefore sometimes refuse to sell fuel to foreign vehicles. Diesel is generally not sold to private individuals. Despite legal requirements, only a few streets, buildings and public transport are barrier-free. Sidewalks and ramps are often in poor condition. Barrier-free means of transport in La Paz include the Teleférico cable car and the Puma-Katari bus. Drivers are often inconsiderate towards pedestrians. If you are involved in a traffic accident, you should always wait for the police to arrive. Leaving the scene of an accident early is prohibited under Bolivian law.', ""Driver's license"": 'The international driving license is required and is only valid in conjunction with the national German driving license.', 'Hikes, tours, visits to national parks': 'Hikes and mountain tours are possible throughout the country, especially in the regions around La Paz, near Rurrenabaque in the Bolivian Andes, in Los Yungas and on the Inca Trail. Various tour operators offer tours in Bolivia. Not all of these organizers are officially accredited and some are not even registered as companies. Before booking, you are advised to check whether the provider is officially registered and whether appropriate security measures are in place. This is especially true for adventure tourism. In addition, it can be checked whether the provider is a member of the “Asociación Boliviana de Agencias de Viaje y Turismo” association and has staff trained in first aid, properly functioning equipment and, when traveling at high altitude, oxygen cylinders. Especially in travel destinations outside the big cities (Uyuni, Madidi, Coroico and “Death Road”) there are hardly any ambulances available. In Uyuni, the tourist police have been withdrawn as a point of contact for tourists who have become victims of crime. A thorough check of the tour provider and its facilities before booking is strongly recommended. On high mountain tours, serious accidents sometimes occur, even among experienced mountaineers, due to the extreme altitude and the special local conditions such as overgrown scree. However, there is no mountain rescue service in Bolivia and rescue flights are not possible in many places. Before setting off, you should obtain information from the organizer or local guides about the specific rescue options in an emergency, and if in doubt, ask them emphatically. Restrictions and recommendations from the national park administration (SENAP) for the individual areas should be strictly observed.', 'Special behavioral instructions/spiritual ceremonies': 'Tourists sometimes have the opportunity to take part in shamanic ceremonies - such as ayahuasca for spiritual cleansing. Caution is advised when hallucinogenic substances are offered. These are not banned in Bolivia, but can contain dangerous poisons and, especially when interacting with medication, can pose a massive health risk and even death. Since such ceremonies usually take place far away from cities, quick help is usually not possible. In particular, ayahuasca or yage, a plant from which a drink containing dimethyltryptamine is obtained, has led to medical emergencies on several occasions.', 'LGBTIQ': 'The Bolivian constitution excludes discrimination based on sexual preference. Social acceptance of homosexuality is growing, but large parts of the population are still more conservative and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity can occur. This is more pronounced in the Andean highlands than in Santa Cruz, which is considered more liberal. Registered civil partnerships are generally possible, but marriage between same-sex partners is excluded. Please note the general information for LGBTIQ.', 'Legal specifics': ""Drug offenses such as the acquisition, possession, import and export of all types of drugs are strictly punished in Bolivia. There is a risk of long prison sentences that must be served in Bolivian prisons. It's best to check the contents of your luggage personally several times and make sure you don't have any items you don't recognize. In traffic accidents that result in personal injury, the driver must initially expect to be taken into custody, regardless of who is at fault. Drinking alcohol is prohibited in public."", 'Money/credit cards': 'The national currency is the Boliviano (BOB). In addition to the Boliviano, the USD is also accepted as a means of payment, especially in larger cities.

Multiple entries and exits are permitted. Dual or multiple nationals who do not also have Bolivian citizenship should ensure that they enter Bolivia with a passport that also states that they left the country of their previous stay. Upon arrival at the international airports in La Paz, Santa Cruz and Cochabamba, an entry stamp with the entry date is usually entered in the passport, but often no expiry date. German tourists are granted a residence permit for 90 days. When entering the country by land, border control must necessarily issue an entry stamp in the passport in order to enter legally. For example, it happens that border posts are not manned or that people sometimes go through border controls when entering the country on a night bus. This leads to problems when attempting to leave the country again, as the person is then not registered and fines are due for the illegal stay. If you enter the country without an entry stamp, you should immediately visit the migration authority to get the required stamp, although the above-mentioned penalties will also apply here. You should therefore insist on an entry stamp at the border crossing. At the Villazón/La Quiaca border crossing with Argentina, the special rule applies that the Argentine exit stamp is also valid as proof of entry into Bolivia or the Argentine entry stamp is also valid as proof of exit from Bolivia. For all other travel purposes (e.g. internship, taking up work, studying, etc.) you must first apply for a corresponding visa (visa de objeto determinado) from the Bolivian embassies abroad. Insist on the entry stamp at the border crossing to avoid possible fines.', 'Minors': 'In order to avoid problems when leaving the country again, minors traveling alone should carry powers of attorney from their legal representatives with them. Even if you are traveling with only one parent with custody, the power of attorney from the parent with custody is required. This power of attorney must be translated into Spanish and legalized by a Bolivian diplomatic or consular mission. For stays of more than 90 days, minors traveling alone must, in addition to the above-mentioned power of attorney, present a permit from the local Bolivian juvenile court when leaving the country. The application for this authorization is made by the minor, together with two witnesses, providing the original birth certificate with an apostille.', 'Import regulations': ""The import and export of foreign currency (in cash) up to 10,000 USD is possible without authorization, for amounts between 20,000 and 500,000 USD or the equivalent in another currency, the prior authorization of the Bolivian Central Bank is required.

Regulations that sometimes differ from those in the European Union apply to the import of medication. Medicines that are carried and available over-the-counter cannot be permitted for import. Therefore, when taking any medication you need with you, always carry a doctor's prescription or a translated doctor's order with you. Entry by vehicle The import and export of motor vehicles is strictly regulated. The so-called SIVETUR form must be presented upon entry and exit. When a private vehicle (e.g. motorhome) is imported, it is determined how long it can remain in the country. Extensions of the deadline are not easily possible, even if the vehicle is temporarily no longer roadworthy due to damage.

Therefore, all travelers are strongly recommended to have a yellow fever vaccination before traveling to these areas. The vaccination is valid for international travel from the tenth day. Make sure that you and your children's standard vaccinations are up to date according to the Robert Koch Institute's vaccination calendar. Vaccinations against hepatitis A are recommended as travel vaccinations, and for long-term stays or special exposure, also against dengue fever, hepatitis B and rabies.

The risk of transmission can vary significantly both regionally and seasonally. The infection with Zika viruses, which is primarily transmitted by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes, can lead to malformations in children during pregnancy and cause neurological complications in adults. Please follow the recommendations for your trip, see Zika virus infection.', 'Dengue fever': 'Dengue viruses are transmitted in large parts of the country by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches. In rare cases, serious complications, including possible death, occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see dengue fever. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.

The disease is characterized by high fever and possibly prolonged joint and muscle pain. The symptoms often cannot be clearly distinguished from other mosquito-borne diseases. Chikungunya fever does not always heal without consequences; long-lasting rheumatism-like symptoms rarely occur. There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see also Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see also Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and point out that you are in a malaria area. In Bolivia, malaria tertiana (Plasmodium vivax >99%) mainly occurs. There is a high risk in the Amazon basin (Pando department and northern areas of the Beni and La Paz departments). A low risk exists above 2,500 m\xa0in the rest of Beni Department. Minimal risk in rural areas in the rest of the country above 2,500 m. La Paz and altitudes above 2,500 m are malaria-free. See also the current distribution maps of the Standing Committee on Travel Medicine (StAR) of the DTG. The need for chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) depends on your travel profile. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical or travel doctor before taking them. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions.

However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course.

The rodents that transmit the virus, deprived of their habitat due to deforestation, are increasingly moving to residential areas in search of food. Mammarenaviruses are of minor importance in travel medicine. Strictly adhere to hygienic measures, e.g. washing fruits well before eating them and before peeling them. Wash your hands thoroughly to prevent the risk of infection.', 'Leishmaniasis': 'Both skin/mucous membrane leishmaniasis and organ leishmaniasis occur in rural regions. The parasites are transmitted by small sand flies that are active at dusk and at night and prefer to stay in moist and shady habitats. In the case of insect bites that heal poorly or, for example, if there is a persistent, unexplained fever, both diseases should be ruled out. To avoid leishmaniases, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially in the evening and at night, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Trypanosomiasis („Chagas disease“)': 'In rural areas, transmission of Chagas disease can occur in very simple accommodation. The risk for travelers is very low. Transmission occurs through predatory bugs whose infected feces get into the bite wound or, rarely, through the oral ingestion of contaminated fruit or sugar cane juices. In the acute phase of the disease, flu-like symptoms occur and swelling of the eyelid occurs in up to 50% of those infected. Years after the infection, serious organ changes can occur. Protect yourself from nocturnal predatory bug bites in simple accommodation in the countryside through exposure prophylaxis, particularly through correctly installed bed nets.', 'Altitude sickness (Soroche)': 'At altitudes above 2,500 m, a possible, occasionally life-threatening illness caused by climbing too quickly, which usually only becomes apparent after 24 hours or longer at the height. Warning symptoms can include sleep disorders, headaches, dizziness, vomiting and increasing shortness of breath. If the symptoms do not disappear after a break or an overnight stay, you should descend below an altitude of 2,000 m. Due to the high altitude of La Paz (airport 4,070 m, city center 3,600 m), symptoms of altitude sickness can occur in the first few days after arrival come.

There may be short-term border closures. Find out about local media. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces. Avoid traveling and staying in the immediate border area with Venezuela.', 'crime': ""The crime rate and the risk of becoming a victim of a robbery or other violent crime are high in Brazil, especially in major cities such as Belém, Fortaleza, Maceio, Porto Alegre, Recife, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, São Luiz and São Paulo. There, poor settlements (favelas) are particularly badly affected. The favelas of Rio de Janeiro have recently been repeatedly affected by acts of violence, sometimes resulting in death. Favelas are sometimes controlled by criminals and drug gangs. Armed confrontations, including those involving the police, often result in innocent people falling victim. An increase in criminal incidents is particularly evident on less busy city center streets, on beaches and on access highways to airports. In larger airports, taxis can be booked and paid for in the airport building, which is associated with greater security. Special attention is drawn to crimes related to prostitution (thefts, robberies, assaults, etc.). The administration of drinks containing sleep-inducing or will-altering substances is common. Meetings arranged via dating apps are increasingly being used for attacks and crimes. There are also occasional reports of attacks on guided boat trips in the Amazon region. Perpetrators are often armed and are often under the influence of drugs, so they do not shy away from using weapons, even for trivial reasons. Pickpocketing is more common on crowded buses and trains during rush hour. Travelers are being used as “drug smugglers” against their will and in ignorance. Always be particularly careful in all areas of the country and city. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Store mobile devices inconspicuously, for example in a lockable travel bag, or put them in a safe. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Avoid flashy clothing, watches and (fashion) jewelry and do not wear watches and smartphones visibly in public. Always carry a small amount of money with you so that you can hand it over without resistance. Do not resist attacks. Never leave drinks unattended, especially in bars and other places. Do not bring prostitutes or casual acquaintances into your own hotel room. To reduce the risk of becoming a victim of a - often faked - traffic accident or vehicle theft, refrain from driving overland at night. Do not insist on your right of way. When driving in city traffic, keep the vehicle windows closed, the doors locked and valuables out of sight. Be particularly careful at traffic lights and in slow-moving traffic. On three or more lane roads, use the middle lane. Choose taxis over public transport at night. Be careful about lure offers, for example over the Internet, to take a trip at someone else's expense. Do not take luggage for strangers, check your own luggage. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police. Rio de Janeiro Thefts and robberies continue to occur throughout Rio de Janeiro, including in the popular districts of Copacabana, Ipanema, Leblon, Botafogo, Santa Teresa and the Lapa nightlife district, even during the day. The perpetrators, some of whom operate in groups, are particularly targeting cell phones, jewelry, credit cards and cash. Recently there has been an increasing number of credit cards being copied (particularly in Ipanema and Copacabana) in order to then use them improperly. Credit card fraud often occurs in taxis. The center of Rio is busy and unsafe after hours, on Saturdays and Sundays, and on public holidays. The often deserted streets of the city center should therefore be avoided on weekends, public holidays and at night. After dark and especially during carnival (street carnival and sambodrome), the New Year's Eve fireworks at Copacabana and other major events, increased vigilance is required. There are frequent exchanges of fire in the favelas, in which even bystanders are often harmed. becomes. If possible, hikes in the nature parks in and outside the city should only be undertaken in groups and on marked and busy paths. It is preferable to pay with cash in taxis.Avoid walking on the beach at night. Avoid visiting any favelas in Rio de Janeiro, including those in the southern zone and the center. São Paulo In São Paulo, the historic city center around Praça da Sé (in front of the cathedral) is busy and unsafe during weeknights and after hours on weekends. The same applies to the area around the busy metro station “Estaçao da Luz”, which should be avoided at the times mentioned. There are many homeless people in the city center, some of whom are drug addicts and sometimes harass passers-by. Armed robberies and kidnappings in preferred, better residential areas have also increased and often lead to exchanges of fire with private security forces or police officers (often in plain clothes), even during the day. Be particularly careful throughout the city, even in better areas. The Northeast of Brazil The Northeast suffers from the highest violent crime in Brazil. The state of Bahia (the most violent in Brazil) and its capital Salvador are particularly affected. There are many drug gangs and militias there that fight each other and the police. Fortaleza, Natal and Recife are also among the most dangerous cities in the world. Armed attacks on tourists, cars and intercity buses are not uncommon. Be careful during the day and do not carry valuables with you in a visible manner. Be particularly vigilant when traveling inland. Avoid public transport and always use taxis or other transport services. Avoid walking in the dark and traveling on intercity buses at night.""}","{'General information': 'Due to heavy rainfall, numerous floods have occurred in the states of Rio Grande do Sul and Santa Catarina since November 2023. There were several fatalities and severe damage to the (transportation) infrastructure. The climate is tropical in the north and center and subtropical in the south. Floods and landslides occur regularly during the rainy season, which lasts from November to early April in the south and southeast and from April to July in the northeast. This leads to significant traffic disruptions due to impassable roads and bridges. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Check the weather and road conditions regularly, especially if you are traveling by land. Follow the advice of local authorities.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'There is a well-developed domestic flight network and numerous intercity bus connections. There are hardly any railway connections. There are also subways and trams in major cities. Coming from Germany, luggage must be picked up at the Brazilian entry airport (Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Salvador, Recife, Brasilia, etc.) and checked in again for a possible onward journey to the destination within Brazil. There is no transit, even if this is often claimed when checking in luggage in Germany. Extreme caution is advised when driving due to the poor condition of many roads. There is often a toll on motorways, which can be paid in cash at toll stations. There are numerous electronic speed controls, particularly on these routes, some of which are quite modern. In cities it is generally advisable to use relatively inexpensive taxis or other driving services. Communication in German is usually not possible. English language skills are also not very common outside of the large hotels and tourist centers. Spanish is partially understood in the south of Brazil. Even rudimentary knowledge of Portuguese is gratefully accepted and is helpful in any case. Always drive carefully and defensively. Avoid driving at night. There is an absolute ban on alcohol for drivers. Violations will be rigorously prosecuted and punished with high penalties.', ""Driver's license"": 'To drive vehicles in Brazil during tourist stays, a German driving license and additional proof of identity (passport) are generally sufficient. However, to avoid misunderstandings and communication problems, it is recommended that you carry an international driving license or a certified Portuguese translation of the German national driving license in addition to your national German driving license. Carrying a certified translation is only mandatory for the old gray driving licenses. For driving licenses of classes C, D and E, it should be noted that in Brazil the minimum age of the driving license holder is 21 years.', 'LGBTIQ': 'There are no indications of any particular difficulties; acceptance is particularly good in large cities. Please note the general LGBTIQ travel advice.', 'Legal specifics': 'Drugs Any contact with drugs is strongly discouraged. Drug crimes, including the transport of drugs across national borders, are punished severely in Brazil. There are high penalties, including for drug couriers, and also if luggage, packages, gifts, samples of goods, etc. are to be transported for third parties. Prison sentences regularly have to be served in Brazil - often under difficult to bear conditions. Be suspicious, especially if the trip is being financed. Never leave your luggage unattended or carry packages for strangers. Sexual offenses The sexual abuse of children and young people is punished in Brazil with a prison sentence of between four and ten years. The perpetrators regularly face imprisonment and exposure in the press. Furthermore, if such acts are committed by Germans or against Germans abroad, they will also be prosecuted in Germany. Consensual sexual acts with people under 18 are also punishable under Brazilian law. In the past, taking photos of children and young people in swimwear on the beach led to the Brazilian authorities taking action. Particular caution is therefore strongly advised in this area. Bathing “topless”/changing clothes in public Bathing “topless” is considered causing public nuisance in Brazil; as well as changing clothes in public, e.g. B. on the beach. Both can lead to arrest or legal proceedings. When changing clothes, always go to changing rooms or other suitable rooms. Animal and plant protection Brazil has strict penal regulations to protect flora and fauna. Violations are consistently pursued by the Brazilian authorities and are also punished with prison sentences. Attempts to export wild and protected plants and animals from Brazil are particularly strictly followed. This applies to almost all ornamental fish species from the Amazon basin, to plant seedlings and seeds as well as to insects and spiders (tarantulas). The transport of protected animals or plants from one Brazilian state to another is already a criminal offense - unless there is express government approval. There is an extensive catalog of animals and plants protected in Brazil. Therefore, do not buy, collect or attempt to export animals or plants/seeds. Visiting indigenous protected areas For traveling to indigenous protected areas, a permit must be obtained in advance from FUNAI (National Indigenous Foundation). Anyone found in a protected area without such authorization will face confiscation of their equipment and severe penalties. Find out about living, working and travel conditions in Brazil at the Brazilian embassy in Berlin.', 'Money/credit cards': 'The local currency is the Real (BRL). Major international credit cards are accepted nationwide. Cash withdrawals with German credit cards or bank cards with the Maestro symbol are generally still possible at appropriately marked ATMs (including Citibank, Banco24Horas, Banco do Brasil, Bradesco). However, many travelers report difficulties. It is common to limit the amount of money that can be withdrawn from ATMs daily to between BRL 500 or BRL 2,500 (depending on the bank and region of Brazil). Alternative means of providing money should be considered. V-Pay cards are not accepted outside of Europe. If cash withdrawals from ATMs fail, it is important to keep the bank receipt issued, as the German account is sometimes still debited. Particular attention should be paid to devices that could be used to copy the cards or record the typing of the PIN numbers. Before you leave, check with your bank whether cash withdrawals are permitted in Brazil. Do not rely solely on ATM supplies of BRL. Be particularly careful when withdrawing cash from ATMs. To minimize the risk of robbery and card fraud, use the ATMs during the day on weekdays, if possible in the anterooms of bank branches and not on the street.'}","{'General information': 'Entry and customs regulations for German citizens can change at short notice without the Foreign Office being informed in advance.

Transmission usually occurs through predatory bugs whose infected feces get into the bite wound. In rural areas, infections with Chagas disease can occur in very simple accommodation if protective measures are missing. In the current outbreak, transmission occurred through oral ingestion of the parasites via contaminated fruit or sugar cane juice (“garapa”). This route of transmission appears to be increasing and is now said to be responsible for most cases in endemic areas. In the acute phase of the disease, flu-like symptoms occur and, if transmitted through infected feces, swelling of the eyelid occurs in up to 50%. Years after the infection, serious organ changes and deaths can occur. Avoid drinking non-industrially processed fruit and sugar juices, such as açaí juice. Protect yourself from nighttime predatory bug bites in simple rural accommodation through exposure prophylaxis ,\xa0particularly through correctly installed bed nets.', 'Vaccination protection': ""Yellow fever There has been an increase in yellow fever cases in southeastern Brazil since 2016. There is also a risk of infection in the states of São Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais and Mato Grosso. In the coastal region of the state of Rio de Janeiro (Ilha Grande, Ilhabela and Angra dos Reis), yellow fever cases, including fatalities in unvaccinated travelers returning from travel, have been reported repeatedly. Only a few areas are currently free of yellow fever or have no reported cases so far. Large vaccination campaigns are being carried out in the affected areas. To date, all infections have been acquired in the so-called sylvatic cycle, i.e. when staying in forested areas without an urban cycle (human-mosquito-human transmission, urban yellow fever) being able to establish itself. Brazil does not require proof of yellow fever vaccination when entering from Europe. However, most of Brazil is a\xa0yellow fever endemic area, so vaccination is necessary for personal protection. The threat in the affected regions may change in the short term. Vaccination is strongly recommended for all travelers aged 9 months or older no later than 10 days before entering Brazil. If you subsequently travel to certain third countries, see www.who.int, proof of vaccination protection coming from Brazil may be required upon entry. It can be observed that countries in the South and Central America region are carrying out increased controls and changing entry regulations. For travel medical advice, it is recommended that the exact travel history of the patient, the current epidemiological data and possible onward travel be taken into account when indicating vaccination. If in doubt, the Foreign Office recommends vaccination. If you are unsure, contact your tropical or travel doctor. Make sure that you and your children's standard vaccinations are up to date according to the Robert Koch Institute's vaccination calendar.

The DTG offers current, detailed travel vaccination recommendations for professionals."", 'Dengue fever': 'Dengue viruses are transmitted nationwide by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches and is increasingly affecting travelers. In rare cases, serious complications, including possible death, occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see also dengue fever. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis. Get advice from tropical and/or travel doctors regarding vaccination.', 'Zika virus infection': 'Zika virus infections have not yet been reported, although they have also occurred in neighboring Malaysia and near the border with Brunei. The infection with Zika viruses, which is primarily transmitted by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes, can lead to malformations in children during pregnancy and cause neurological complications in adults. For your travels, follow the recommendations in\xa0 Zika virus infection .', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see also malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. There is a low risk of malaria when traveling into the hinterland with tropical rainforest. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications are available for this (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine). Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrheal illnesses are common travel illnesses, see also diarrheal illnesses. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Japanese encephalitis': 'Isolated cases of Japanese encephalitis have been reported since October 2013. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an inflammation of the brain caused by viruses. These are transmitted by nocturnal mosquitoes. Pigs and waterfowl in particular are infected with the virus without becoming ill themselves. Diseases in humans are rare, but are often severe and often leave lasting damage or are fatal. There are no effective medications against the JE viruses, see also Japanese encephalitis. To avoid Japanese encephalitis, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis and get vaccinated.', 'rabies': 'Rabies cases occur in Brunei in rare cases. Rabies is a regularly fatal infectious disease that is caused by viruses that are transmitted in the saliva of infected animals or people (through bites, licking of injured skin areas or droplets of saliva on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes). Vaccination offers reliable protection against the disease, see also rabies.', 'Influenza': 'Influenza infections are more common during the rainy seasons, and the new influenza A/H1N1 has also spread throughout the country since 2009.', 'Medical care': 'The medical infrastructure in the country offers well-structured inpatient and emergency care by doctors who have mostly come from other Asian countries. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG.

Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces.', 'crime': ""Petty crime such as pickpocketing occurs particularly in busy places such as airports and train stations as well as in places heavily frequented by tourists. Thefts from unlocked cars have occurred both in and out of town where the driver was briefly distracted, for example due to a flat tire. Vehicle thefts occur occasionally, with higher-value cars with foreign license plates being preferred targets. There are guarded parking spaces in some places; However, no liability will be accepted if the vehicle is stolen. Given the high number of refugees, picking up hitchhikers could constitute the criminal offense of smuggling under Bulgarian law, which carries high penalties. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Be particularly attentive in large crowds and look after your valuables. Always lock vehicles and do not leave visible objects or valuables and documents in the vehicle. Do not pick up unknown hitchhikers. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'Bulgaria is located in a seismically active zone, which is why earthquakes can occur. The climate is predominantly continental with warm summers and relatively cold winters. Dangerous underwater currents often arise in the Black Sea, even near the beach. Fatal swimming accidents occasionally occur. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities and lifeguards. Even in shallow waters, pay attention to whether swimming is actually permitted there. Familiarize yourself with what to do during earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.'}","{'border controls': ""Bulgaria is on the most important transit route for road traffic from Germany via Serbia or Romania to Turkey. During the holiday season, holiday traffic - especially on weekends - often causes traffic jams at border crossings with waiting times of several hours. It is therefore recommended to avoid traveling on weekends during this time and to opt for weekdays. Bulgaria's borders with Serbia, Turkey and the Republic of North Macedonia are EU external borders. Since Bulgaria is not part of the Schengen area, ID and customs checks must be expected at all border crossings. As part of the border controls, the driver of the vehicle is also checked for unpaid warning fines. Due to extensive construction work on the Bulgarian side, depending on the general traffic situation, there are always additional traffic jams at the Kalotina/Gradinje border crossing (Serbia), which means longer waiting times have to be taken into account. At the Ruse/Giurgiu and Calafat/Vidin border crossings with Romania, there may continue to be significant delays, especially when there is increased traffic on long weekends and during the holiday season, especially in truck clearance."", 'Infrastructure/transport': ""There are domestic flights, train and bus services as well as taxis. When using taxis, you should pay attention to the price sticker, which is required by law for all taxis and which is located on the rear door window, before boarding. Most have a tariff of around 1 BGN per unit (varies day or night). In some cases, much higher prices are charged (e.g. in holiday resorts). This is not illegal and may vary depending on the region. All taxis in Bulgaria are yellow or beige and equipped with taximeters. In individual cases the taximeters may be manipulated. Reputable taxi companies usually have an app that you can register with and use to reliably order a taxi. The condition of many roads (mainly in urban areas, but also country roads) is poor. Large and deep holes in the surface as well as stones and other unpredictable obstacles are not uncommon. Because of the associated risk of accidents and damage, increased vigilance is required, especially when driving in the dark. You are required to drive with dipped headlights all year round, even during the day. The maximum speed for normal cars (Category B, no minibuses for passenger transport), unless other regulations have been made locally, is 50 km/h in urban areas, 90 km/h outside of urban areas, 120 km/h on expressways and 140 km/h on motorways. The maximum permissible blood alcohol concentration for drivers is 0.5 per mille. Violations of the road traffic regulations can result in fines and prison sentences and - especially in the case of alcohol violations and speeding - the revocation of a driver's license and, if necessary, the confiscation of license plates. Drivers with a blood alcohol concentration of over 1.2 per mille can have their vehicle impounded until the court proceedings are completed. If the driver is not the owner of the vehicle, he must pay a deposit equal to the equivalent value of the vehicle in question. Police checks on country roads and motorways are frequent. Traffic police officers are required to wear reflective protective vests and a badge with a photo, name and unit. Fines for violations of the road traffic regulations are never payable directly to the traffic police officers inspecting them, but only non-cash by bank deposit. The driver of the vehicle is also checked for unpaid fines as part of the border control. If unpaid fines are discovered for which the objection periods have expired and which are not statute-barred, the matter will be handed over to the locally responsible national police on site. The driver has the option of paying the fine directly at the border crossing. Otherwise, you can expect that your driver's license and possibly the vehicle will be confiscated, which will result in further costs. The Shipka Pass on the E 85 is closed to vehicles over ten tons all year round. Winter tires are mandatory nationwide from November 15th to March 1st (at least four mm tread). Bulgaria has introduced mandatory disinfection (for a fee) for vehicles coming from Turkey. This may lead to additional congestion at the Turkish-Bulgarian borders. All vehicles, except motorcycles, require a vignette on Bulgarian national roads, which is only available digitally against payment by bank or credit card. The vignette can be purchased online from BGToll or at gas stations, border crossings and from road authorities. There are vignettes for a day, a weekend, a week, a month, three months or a year. It is recommended that you carry the order confirmation, which serves as a receipt, and keep it beyond the validity period. The weekly and monthly vignettes are valid from the day of purchase up to and including the same day of the following week or month. The annual vignette is valid for one year from a desired date. This date is selected/determined by the customer when purchasing the vignette. Anyone who drives without a valid vignette must pay a fine of BGN 300, but can alternatively make a compensation payment of BGN 70, which will enable them to purchase the required vignette promptly, i.e. on the same day. However, if you drive again without a vignette, a fine will be due."", ""Driver's license"": 'The German driving license is valid and sufficient.', 'LGBTIQ': 'Discrimination based on sexual orientation is prohibited in Bulgaria. However, social acceptance of the LGBTIQ community is weaker compared to other EU member states. Neither same-sex marriages nor registered partnerships are currently permitted. The Bulgarian Constitutional Court declared in 2018 that the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, also known as the Istanbul Convention, does not comply with the Bulgarian constitution. Please note the general information for LGBTIQ.', 'Legal specifics': 'Bulgaria is a transit country on the so-called ""Balkan route"" for international drug smuggling. Criminals convicted of drug offenses must expect severe and long prison sentences. If you attempt to cross the border illegally, for example by hiding people in the car (even if the destination of the journey is not Bulgaria but Germany), the vehicle used can be confiscated as an “instrument of crime” without compensation in favor of the Bulgarian state. The Bulgarian authorities may impose an exit ban on foreigners accused of a criminal offense in Bulgaria, which is usually maintained for the entire duration of the investigation. The consequence – also for tourists – can be a forced stay in Bulgaria for months. As a result of a criminal conviction, a ban on re-entry for one or more years is often imposed.', 'Money/credit cards': 'The national currency is the Lev (BGN). Cash should be exchanged in banks rather than in exchange offices. ATMs are widespread. The maximum amount that is usually paid out is currently BGN 400. When using ATMs and paying by credit card, take standard anti-fraud precautions to prevent PIN spying, ATM tampering or card copying.

The principle of no checks on goods does not exclude random checks as part of police surveillance of borders and police control of cross-border traffic. If entry does not take place directly from another EU country, it may be necessary to prove that the goods were purchased within the EU. Large quantities of alcohol, coffee and similar highly taxed goods may need to be substantiated as being intended for personal, non-commercial use. If the declaration obligations are not observed, the entire amount imported or exported will be confiscated to the benefit of the Bulgarian state without compensation. Fines may also be imposed. Foreigners may also import and export precious metals, stones and products without declaring them: up to 37 g of gold and platinum (in raw or worked state and coins), 60 g of gold or platinum jewelry, 300 g of silver (in raw or processed condition, coins and jewelry) For larger quantities, a written customs declaration must be submitted.

Foreign patients generally have to pay the costs of medical treatment on site in cash. It should be noted that the costs of medical treatment for foreigners can be relatively high. In any case, you should insist on issuing a formal invoice/receipt. On Golden Sands it is increasingly becoming apparent that private doctors, some of whom have their practices in hotels, charge very high fees even for simpler treatments. German doctors also occasionally report complex and expensive misdiagnoses and unnecessary treatments. If you do not pay, you will be threatened with being prevented from leaving the country and having your passport confiscated. In individual cases, tourists are harassed by the doctor's service staff or sometimes by individual hotel employees to pay the bill and are even harassed further with telephone calls upon arrival in Germany.

Particularly in the summer months, devastating, widespread bush and forest fires can occur in many places and, as a result, disruptions to traffic, power supplies and communications. Bush and forest fires Particularly in the summer months, sometimes devastating, widespread bush and forest fires can occur in many places and, as a result, disruptions to traffic, power supplies and communication. Stay informed about the media and pay attention to the notices and warning levels of the Chilean civil protection agency SENAPRED. On site, familiarize yourself with the designated evacuation routes and what to do in the event of earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences. Follow weather reports regularly in local media. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'Chile is a well-developed travel destination. Almost all parts of the country can be reached by rental cars, modern intercity buses and by plane. There are train connections from Santiago only to the south (to Chillán). Disruptions may occur in the event of strikes. There are taxis in the cities and a subway in Santiago. Car and bus accidents, sometimes serious, occur again and again on the asphalted intercity roads and gravel roads, especially in the north of Chile. The reason is usually technical defects in the vehicles, excessive speed or inappropriate driving style and driver fatigue. In the winter months from June to August, environmental problems associated with increased air pollution occur in Santiago and other larger cities in southern Chile. Driving bans are also regularly imposed. The dangers arising from the long distances due to the enormous north-south geographical extent, the sometimes extreme climate and sudden changes in the weather are often underestimated. Border areas with the neighboring states of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, various smaller islands in the 12th region and in the 5th region (Sector San Antonio - Tejas Verdes) are still partly mined, even near tourist resorts and in nature reserves. Landmines were cleared from public streets and paths; Off-site minefields are usually marked. However, the marking of minefields is not ensured across the board or is no longer available in impassable terrain. When renting a car and organizing tours, pay attention to the technical condition of the vehicles and adapt your driving style to the climatic and road conditions. Plan travel routes as detailed and forward-looking as possible and plan long routes. Be sure to pay attention to warning signs in border areas. Especially in remote areas, only move on paved roads and paths or with local guides.', ""Driver's license"": 'The German national driving license is sufficient for short-term visits of up to 90 days. For possible police checks and car rentals, it is advisable to carry a Spanish translation or the German multilingual international driving license.', 'Hikes/trekking tours': 'Climbing mountains and volcanoes and trekking pose considerable risks; Accidents and deaths occur again and again. The Villarica and Osorno volcanoes are known for their dangerous fissures. When entering the respective park, local carabiñeros or national park administrations will ask for the approximate route and duration of the hike in order to make any search operations easier. Lake Chungará on the Chilean-Bolivian border lies at 4,500 meters. Day trips by bus are offered from the sea-level town of Arica. The difference in altitude, combined with the effort of the journey, causes altitude sickness in many tourists, especially older people, which has already led to deaths. In the mountains, weather conditions can also change very quickly. In the dry desert areas of northern Chile, despite the high daytime temperatures, it gets very cold at night (e.g. on trips to the El Tatio high plateau near San Pedro de Atacama). Do not go on hikes and mountain tours alone, but only accompanied by recognized local guides. Make sure you have good equipment and sufficient travel insurance that covers mountain rescue by helicopter and medical evacuation. Before going on a tour, find out exactly what the weather is like. Leave information about the planned route and arrival times with organizers or relatives. Be sure to follow instructions and restrictions from local authorities and national park administrations. Because of the risk of altitude sickness, make sure you acclimatize slowly, e.g. B. by spending the night in the town of Putre, located at an altitude of 3,400 meters. Only use guarded campsites.

Stricter controls are taking place particularly in cities or at their access points and main traffic arteries. Freedom of movement is restricted. Personal, passport and baggage checks at access points to markets, parks and public places, among others, are the rule. Foreign travelers must show their passport, provide their telephone number and have their photo taken at police checks. Detailed questioning by security forces, even after checking into hotels, must be expected. When taking photos and films, even with a smartphone, it is important to ensure that no police or security forces or installations are photographed. Failure to comply may result in a temporary arrest. Arrests and passport confiscations have increased in Xinjiang in recent years. People of Uighur descent are particularly affected. Be particularly careful when traveling to the Uyghur Autonomous Region. Do not photograph police or security forces or installations. Expect your smartphone and camera to be checked and questioned by security forces. Expect stricter checks when entering China. Take this into account especially if you are of Uyghur descent or have close personal contacts in Xinjiang.

Central y 7 regularly experiences pickpocketing, after dark the danger increases. The use of weapons is rare, but possible. Lonely or confusing areas should be avoided. There have been several recent incidents involving taxis waiting for passengers at bus stations and forcing extremely high fares or robbing passengers of their luggage (including using force).

If you spend the night in a motorhome, please look for guarded parking spaces or official campsites. In the event of a breakdown, do not stop immediately, but drive to the nearest workshop or gas station or call professional help. In the past, vehicle breakdowns were faked by third parties in order to rob those who stopped to help, and punctures were provoked by nails or similar in order to force a stop and then rob those affected.

The pathogens are increasingly transmitted by the mosquito species Anopheles stephensi, which appears to be particularly well adapted to heat. There is a high risk of malaria all year round. Get advice on medication prophylaxis. Nationwide, including Djibouti City, there is a high risk of malaria all year round. The proportion of malaria tropica ( P. falciparum ) is 75%, 25% are malaria tertiana cases ( P. vivax ). The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood contact/transfusion.

However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food.

If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is endemic throughout the East African region and also in Djibouti. There are always introductions from neighboring countries. Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course.

Many snakes are nocturnal, so you should avoid walking around outdoors at night if possible. Do not reach into holes or crevices in the ground, under stones or brushwood, twigs or similar confusing material. There are also some poisonous species of spiders and scorpions and other animals with potentially strong toxic effects such as: B. certain strikingly colored butterfly caterpillars and centipedes. Be careful of poisonous animals when reaching, walking, sitting and lying down. Before use, shake out duvets and sheets, clothing, footwear and headgear.

Protesters routinely block local streets and major highways, often without notice. Demonstrations can last for several days or weeks. Road blockades can significantly limit access to public transport, health services and airports, and disrupt travel both within and between cities. Traffic disruptions caused by demonstrations, road blockades or strikes force travelers to inquire locally about alternative travel options and, if necessary, to wait for the situation to return to normal.

Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Be sure to follow the instructions of local authorities and security forces. Above all, avoid the immediate border area with Colombia.', 'crime': ""The crime rate and willingness to use violence are high. Violent clashes between criminal gangs and shootouts between security forces and criminal gangs have increased sharply across the country. Occasionally, attacks are also carried out by drug gangs and criminal groups. In such events, even uninvolved people can be affected. Particular caution is required in the following areas: (The description of danger zones is approximate; risks cannot be limited to precisely defined areas) Guayaquil, especially south of Avenida Portete de Tarquí and Durán, El Oro Province, especially. in the cities of Huaquillas and Arenillas, Los Rios Province, especially in the cities of Quevedo, Quinsaloma and Pueblo Viejo, Esmeraldas Province, especially in Esmeraldas City and the northern areas, provinces of Sucumbíos, Manabí (northern border region to Esmeraldas Province), Santa Elena and Santo Domingo, especially in Santo Domingo city. Furthermore, petty crime (pickpocketing) occurs particularly in large cities in places heavily frequented by tourists and on intercity buses. A significant increase in petty crime, some of which is violent, can be observed throughout the country, particularly in Esmeraldas, Santo Domingo, Quevedo and Guayaquíl and the surrounding area. Especially in the city of Esmeraldas, special caution is required in public from the early afternoon. The risk of attack is increased in the metropolises of Guayaquíl and Quito as well as on the coast; The risk is particularly high in the province of Esmeraldas, the coastal area in and around the city of Esmeraldas and when visiting the city of Santo Domingo. In the north of Esmeraldas province there are repeated violent incidents that are attributed to organized crime and have resulted in several deaths and numerous injuries, including among civilians. Violent incidents also occur again and again in the provinces of Guayas and Santo Domingo de los Tsáchilas. Violent crime is increasing in connection with gang fights and attacks on the police and judiciary. Drug-related crime has also increased sharply. For this reason, there is currently an increasing number of vehicle and personal checks by the police and military. Throughout the border region with Colombia, there is an increased risk of falling victim to kidnappings and the activities of armed groups linked to drug trafficking. In larger cities, in tourist hotspots (e.g. the Mariscal Sucre nightlife district in Quito) and especially in buses and bus stations, thefts, robberies and sexual crimes occur to a significant and increasing extent. The perpetrators use a variety of tricks, such as diversionary tactics, “fine” extortion using false uniforms, robbery or rape after administering consciousness-reducing drugs (also in the form of powder in food, drinks or on brochures), and robberies by taxi drivers in unregistered taxis that actively appeal to potential customers. In emergencies, the police can be reached around the clock in Spanish on 911. The German embassy in Quito offers information on how to report crimes. When traveling in the provinces listed under Current News - State of Emergency, clarify the current security situation with the tour operator before you start your trip and be particularly careful. In the dark, use a registered door-to-door taxi or Uber even for shorter journeys. Always pay attention to your luggage and do not carry watches, cameras and cell phones conspicuously on the street. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Be particularly vigilant and look after your valuables in large crowds such as airports, train stations, markets and public transport. Never leave drinks unattended or accept them from strangers. In the event of an attack, do not resist under any circumstances. When choosing local tour companies, pay attention to appropriate safety precautions and when hiking, pay attention to local advice. Only make cross-country journeys (including on buses) during the day and always pay attention to your luggage, especially on buses. Do not stow it on the luggage rack or under your seat, even if you are asked to do so by (supposedly) bus company employees. Beware of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintancesskeptical. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'Earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis Ecuador is located in a very seismically active zone, which is why more severe earthquakes and volcanic activity occur more frequently. Most recently, a magnitude 6.8 earthquake occurred on March 18, 2023. The worst affected were the provinces of El Oro (Machala), Guayas (Guayaquil) and Azuay (Cuenca). In particular, the volcanoes Sangay (in Sangay Park) and Reventador (about 90 km east of Quito) are currently active. The volcanoes Cotopaxi and Tungurahua (in the tourist area of \u200b\u200bBaños) are under intensive observation. We point out possible evacuations and disruptions to travel, possibly also through short-term closures of Guayaquil and Quito airports. Following earthquakes along the Pacific coasts, there is also a risk of tsunamis, particularly in Esmeraldas and Manabí. Floods There is a hot, humid tropical climate in the coastal area and eastern lowlands, and a temperate climate with strong temperature fluctuations in the Andean highlands. In the winter months, especially from January to April, floods and landslides often occur in the coastal region and in the high mountains due to rainfall. As a result, severe damage to traffic routes can occur, which affects travel safety. Bush and forest fires Bush and forest fires occur again and again, especially in the summer months, due to the prevailing climatic conditions, especially in Pichincha. In these cases, an impairment of the infrastructure must be expected. Follow weather reports regularly and expect traffic delays. You should therefore always find out promptly about the current situation in the affected regions, about earthquakes and volcanic activity as well as current warning levels from the Instituto Geofísico – Escuela Politécnica Nacional, Quito-Ecuador.

The overseas territories have a tropical or subtropical climate. Flash floods, which have claimed fatalities in the past, occur more frequently, particularly in summer and early autumn. Isolated, severe autumn storms can occur in the Mediterranean, particularly from August to November. There can be a risk of avalanches in the French Alps during the winter months. Bush and forest fires Particularly in southern France and Corsica, bush and forest fires occur regularly, especially in the summer months, due to the prevailing climatic conditions with periods of drought. Traffic routes are often closed in areas affected by forest fires. Power supply and communication infrastructure failures may occur. Tropical storms in the overseas territories In the Caribbean, hurricane season is from June to the end of November (Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint-Martin and Saint-Barthélemy), in the Indian Ocean from January to April (La Réunion and Mayotte), in the South Pacific from November to April (French Polynesia and New Caledonia). Tropical storms must be expected during this time. Earthquakes and volcanoes New Caledonia, Wallis-et-Futuna, La Réunion and Mayotte as well as the Caribbean overseas territories are located in some very seismically active zones, which is why more severe earthquakes and significant volcanic activity can occur. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Keep yourself informed about the weather conditions. You can obtain current information from the media, e.g. on Météo France, and from announcements from the prefectures and municipalities in which you are staying. Pay attention to signs on the highways, barriers and warnings. Traffic information can also be found on the Bison Futé website. In the event of a storm warning, please pay particular attention to the information on hurricanes abroad or the information from the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance. When traveling to overseas territories, familiarize yourself with what to do during earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis.

Almost all motorways in France are toll roads. A red light sign in the shape of a cross on the back of the traffic light for oncoming traffic signals that it is red and that a quick left turn is possible when the traffic light is green, as long as there are no priority pedestrians at the intersection. A yellow flashing arrow when the traffic lights are turned red signals possible priority crossing traffic. At traffic intersections that are designed and signposted as roundabouts (“carrefour giratoire”), the entering vehicle must give way. Unless otherwise signposted, right before left applies - even in roundabout-like intersections (“rond point”), which means that incoming traffic generally has the right of way. At multi-lane roundabout-like intersections, priority must be given to the vehicle traveling in the outside lane. Solid yellow stripes on the edge of the road mean there is an absolute no-parking zone and intermittent parking is prohibited. Blue markings on the edge of the road indicate limited and possibly paid parking with parking discs (Zones Bleues). The alcohol limit is 0.5; for novice drivers in the first two years 0.2. The maximum speed on country roads was reduced from 90 to 80 km/h in 2018. Environmental zones have now been introduced in the city center of Paris, which is surrounded by the Boulevard Périphérique urban motorway ring, and in numerous other major French cities.

Motor vehicles registered for the first time before January 1, 1997 and motorcycles registered for the first time before June 1, 1999 will not be issued an environmental sticker. Violations can be punished with fines. Within the environmental zones, areas can be closed to vehicles of certain pollutant classes or parking bans can be set up. German environmental stickers are not recognized. The French environmental sticker Certificat Qualité de l'Air can also be ordered for motor vehicles registered in Germany based on information from the valid German registration documents.

Transmission of yellow fever is to be expected nationwide. Make sure that you and your children's standard vaccinations are up to date according to the Robert Koch Institute's vaccination calendar. Vaccinations against hepatitis A are recommended as travel vaccinations, and for long-term stays or special exposure also against hepatitis B, typhus and rabies. The DTG offers current, detailed travel vaccination recommendations for professionals. Malaria Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. In French Guiana there is a medium risk all year round along the rivers, particularly the Oiapoque, Approuague, Mana and Maroni rivers. There is also a medium risk in the regions around the Petit Saut Dam and Saül as well as Grand Santi and Maripasoula. The coastal region, including the towns of Kourou and Cayenne, are considered malaria-free. The proportion of malaria tertiana (P. vivax) is over 97%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under a waterproof blanketmosquito net. When traveling to areas with a medium risk of malaria that are more than 48 hours away from the nearest medical facility with the possibility of malaria diagnosis and treatment, it is recommended to take appropriate medication with you for emergency self-treatment. Please seek medical advice regarding the selection of appropriate medications. Trypanosomiasis (“Mal de Chagas”) In French Guiana, American trypanosomiasis (Chagas) can be transmitted through the excretions of predatory bugs that live in cracks in simple dwellings in rural areas. These can be ingested through the bite of infected bugs or, more rarely, through contaminated fruit or sugar cane juices. Correctly attached bed nets can provide protection against bites. In the acute phase of the disease, flu-like symptoms and possibly swelling of the eyelid are the main symptoms. Up to years after the infection, serious organ changes in the heart and digestive tract can occur. Overall, however, the risk for travelers is very low. Use correctly installed bed nets to protect against bites.

These incidents mostly occurred in the evening and at night, and main roads were also affected. Luggage theft occasionally occurs in hotel lobbies. Property crimes and violent crimes can occur on the beaches. There is a risk of kidnapping and robbery in the Northern Region, North-East, Savannah Region, Upper West and Upper East, including on main routes. In Ghana there are repeated attempts at fraud (scamming) by pretending to have romantic relationships or intentions to marry, as well as in supposed transactions such as the acquisition of property or fictitious inheritance payments. If you come into personal contact with fraudster gangs, there is a real risk of physical attacks and kidnappings. Credit card fraud and scams with alleged discounts are also widespread. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Do not show these in public. If possible, avoid using credit cards and never give them away; instead, insist on paying with mobile terminals or remain present during the payment process. Be particularly vigilant and watch your valuables in large crowds such as airports, cultural events, buses, tro-tros, taxis or Ubers, and hotel lobbies. Avoid driving overland in the dark. Lock the vehicle doors and close the windows. Observe your surroundings while driving to identify suspicious situations of possible pursuit. Do not leave valuable items in the car and prefer illuminated and guarded parking spaces. Do not resist an attack. Do not walk alone after dark and avoid deserted beaches. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, expressions of love, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances and therefore do not travel to Ghana yourself. Find out about scamming at the German Embassy in Accra.""}","{'General information': 'The climate is tropical, hot and humid. During the rainy seasons from the end of April to the end of July and in September and October, there may be isolated flooding in all parts of the country, including in the cities, in the Northern Region, North-East, Savannah Region, Upper West and Upper East, associated with landslides, come. As a result, roads and bridges can become impassable. The Harmattan brings sand and dust winds from the Sahara during the dry season from December to March, which can also lead to traffic disruptions. Ghana is located in a seismically active zone, so earthquakes can occur. Follow the weather reports during the rainy seasons. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Familiarize yourself with what to do in the event of an earthquake. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': ""Local and long-distance public transport is available in Ghana. Despite fixed departure points and routes, there are no fixed departure times. Many buses and taxis are in poor technical condition. Buses from the state-owned company STC or the private provider VIP are the most reliable and air-conditioned. The semi-public company Metro Mass Transit is currently expanding its offering of non-air-conditioned buses in the country's metropolitan areas. Inexpensive minibuses (Tro-Tro) are often only technically suitable for road use to a limited extent and are therefore at high risk of accidents. Ghana has a growing network of developed intercity roads. The risk of accidents is very high due to sometimes significant road damage, deep potholes, unlit and damaged vehicles on the roads and unpaved sections. Traffic or protection police officers often stop vehicles for traffic violations or to check driver's licenses, passports and residence permits (visas). Taxis are available in the cities and can be used either as shared taxis or by the passenger alone. There are no taxi meters. Taxi drivers try to take advantage of inexperienced visitors to the country, especially when taking taxis from the airport to the city. In some cases, taxi drivers require foreigners to pay the fare in foreign currency. Drivers also often refuse trips when they use credit cards as payment method. When using Uber, there have been attempts at fraud when depositing electronic payment methods and credit cards. Most of the time, the rear windows in the car are darkened with a privacy film and are therefore safer. Although street names in Ghana are assigned by the state, they are hardly known among the population or even among taxi drivers. Well-known buildings (e.g. National Theater or the large hotels) as well as prominent intersections serve as orientation. In contrast to Europe, the passenger must know the route to the destination and instruct the taxi driver. For your first journeys from the airport, it is advisable to head for the well-known large hotels and then, if necessary, get redirected. Taxis can also be hired by the day or hour. Rental cars are usually available in the hotels. Always drive defensively and carefully and\xa0obey traffic laws. Avoid driving overland in the dark. It is best to travel overland by bus with the STC or VIP. If possible, avoid using minibuses (Tro-Tro). Always sit in the back of taxis and lock the doors. Always negotiate and agree on taxi fares before you start your journey. Have enough small notes ready to change and do not pay with foreign currencies. When traveling with Uber in Accra and Kumasi, only use cash, not credit card, as your payment method."", ""Driver's license"": 'The international driving license is required and is only valid in conjunction with the national German driving license.', 'LGBTIQ': 'Ghanaian criminal law provides for up to three years in prison for homosexual acts.

Please note the general information for LGBTIQ.', 'Legal specifics': 'Possession, trafficking and consumption of drugs is punished harshly; the minimum sentence for possession and consumption is five years in prison, even for the smallest quantities, and at least ten years in prison for trafficking. Prison sentences of up to three years are also imposed for promoting prostitution. Restrictions on photography introduced in 1982 have recently been significantly relaxed. However, it is still not recommended to photograph military installations, troops, ministries and public buildings, trains and railway systems, ports, airports, aircraft, bridges, dams or larger power substations. There is a strict ban on photography, especially in the area around the official residence of the head of state (Jubilee House) and the headquarters of the general staff (Burma Camp). Also ask for prior permission when photographing people.', 'Money/credit cards': ""The national currency is the Cedi (GHS). Cedis can be exchanged at government-approved FOREX offices. The cheapest rates are available for cash. Credit cards are only accepted in larger hotels and restaurants and should only be used in exceptional cases due to the risk of misuse. A bank card can be used to withdraw cash at certain banks' ATMs with corresponding symbols. When withdrawing with credit cards, data including the PIN is often read and a copy is then made, which is then misused. In the event of financial emergencies, it is possible to transfer money via the relevant internationally operating financial transaction service providers.""}","{'General information': 'Entry and customs regulations for German citizens can change at short notice without the Foreign Office being informed in advance.

The application is submitted online, after which fees must be paid and complete application documents, including the passport, must be sent to the Embassy of Ghana in Berlin by post or in person. The visa fees charged are displayed during the electronic application; general information on the embassy website is not relevant in case of doubt. Applicants will generally not receive any further notice if the paper documents have been submitted incompletely or the fees have been paid incompletely. Processing generally takes ten or three working days for “express visas” from receipt of complete documents and fees at the embassy. Even if a visa is issued for more than two months, it is automatically limited to a validity of 60 days upon entry. If necessary, an extension must be applied for in good time at the Immigration Service with two passport photos. If you intend to stay longer than the visa is valid or visit one of the neighboring countries during your stay, a visa extension or a so-called re-entry visa is necessary. Both must be applied for early on at the Ghana Immigration Service. An illegal stay (beyond the validity of the visa) is penalized with a heavy fine and generally leads to the refusal of future visa applications.

Standard vaccinations: Make sure that you and your children have up to date standard vaccinations according to the RKI vaccination calendar. Due to repeated outbreaks, adequate vaccination protection against measles in particular should be ensured.', 'Medical care': 'The medical care in Ghana is not comparable to the care in Germany. Outside the large centers, there is a lack of medical professionals in many places. Planned operations, procedures and diagnostics should be carried out in Europe. Emergency and basic care is provided in large state hospitals and many private clinics. The pharmacies have a sufficient range of important standard medications. Counterfeit medications with unsafe contents occur. Get travel medical advice early on and adjust your vaccination protection.

There is a high risk of infection for both diseases all year round throughout the country, including the cities. The proportion of the dangerous malaria tropica ( P. falciparum ) is over 99%. The DTG provides a map of malaria risk areas. In addition, there are the following mosquito-borne diseases that can occur throughout the year: dengue fever, leishmaniasis, lymphatic filariasis and West Nile fever. It can be assumed that chikungunya fever and Zika virus infections also occur. Protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites throughout the day. Use mosquito repellent regularly and wear appropriate clothing. Use bed nets at night, see Protection from insects. A vaccination against yellow fever is mandatory. There is a vaccination against dengue fever; Get advice about your personal risk. To prevent malaria, it is advisable to take tablets in addition to mosquito repellent in areas with a high risk of malaria. Please seek medical advice regarding the selection of appropriate medications. Crimean-Congo fever, which mainly occurs in rural areas in Ghana, is transmitted by ticks. Tsetse flies are the carriers of African sleeping sickness, which is now rare in Ghana. Protect yourself from ticks and tsetse flies, especially when spending time outdoors. Check your body carefully after spending time outdoors, see Protecting yourself from insects.', 'Illnesses related to poor hygiene': ""In particular, poor drinking water, food and hand hygiene can lead to illnesses that are often accompanied by diarrhea. Undetermined traveler's diarrhea and shigellosis often occur. Cholera, on the other hand, almost never affects travelers. Certain viral diseases of the liver (viral hepatitis A and E) and typhoid fever also occur in travelers. Poliomyelitis (cVDPV2) has been detected in Ghana. Please note our basic hygiene instructions. Get advice about a typhoid vaccination. Ensure full vaccination protection against poliomyelitis. According to WHO guidelines, for stays longer than 4 weeks, a vaccination should take place 4 weeks to 12 months before leaving the affected country. For stays of less than 4 weeks, a booster vaccination is recommended if the last vaccination was administered more than 10 years ago, see poliomyelitis vaccination. Get advice about a cholera vaccination if you work long-term in cholera epidemic areas, for example as medical staff or disaster relief workers."", 'Human-to-human transmitted diseases': 'Ghana is at risk for meningococcal disease, Lassa fever and tuberculosis.

Heed local warnings. Seek medical advice regarding a meningococcal ACWY vaccination. In addition to classic sexually transmitted diseases such as syphillis or gonorrhea, diseases such as AIDS, Mpox or certain viral diseases of the liver (viral hepatitis B, C and D) can be transmitted through sexual contact. In principle, transmission is also possible through drug use with unclean syringes or cannulas, tattoos and blood transfusions. Always use condoms, especially with casual acquaintances. Get medical advice about a hepatitis B vaccination.', 'Diseases transmitted through animal contact': 'Hantavirus infections and leptospirosis are usually transmitted through contact with infectious rodent excretions. Lassa fever can also be transmitted through contact with bush meat. Infection with rabies occurs through dogs, monkeys and flying foxes and plays a special role due to the proximity of these animals to people. Bird flu can be transmitted through contact with birds and poultry. Poisonous snakes are particularly common in rural areas. When traveling, always avoid contact with animals and their excrement. If you are bitten by a dog, monkey, flying fox or poisonous snake, seek medical attention immediately. Antivenoms are only available to a limited extent in Ghana.

In Guatemala City, using the red city buses is dangerous, the green city buses (“Transmetro”) and the blue buses (“Transurbano”) are considered relatively safe. Robberies are occasionally carried out on public buses. Attacks on pedestrians and drivers take place at any time of day, even in busy rush hour traffic, and are usually committed by several armed perpetrators together. The business and entertainment district “Zona Viva” of Zone 10, where most hotels and restaurants are located, is also not completely safe. The risk of attacks and attacks also generally exists in tourist centers such as Antigua, Flores, Tikal and Lake Atitlán, as well as when visiting volcanoes. Resistance can have serious consequences in the event of an attack, as weapons (in addition to firearms, other weapons such as machetes) are widespread and the inhibition threshold for their use is low. Recently there has been an increasing number of serious injuries, sometimes fatal, in robberies. Arbitrary measures by security forces can also be directed against foreigners. It is strongly advised not to purchase a car in Guatemala. Sales of stolen vehicles have increased in recent months. Vehicles and their documents are checked very carefully at border crossings and during police checks. The Interpol database is queried. In the case of stolen vehicles, there is a risk of high fines or prison sentences, but the vehicle in question can be confiscated. Be particularly careful in large crowds and also when traveling inland and avoid carrying or showing valuables. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss.

Avoid lonely streets and unpopulated areas not only at night, but also during the day if possible. Only undertake excursions to the volcanoes when accompanied by the police or licensed guides; You should also not go on other hikes or trekking tours alone. Don't underestimate the danger of straying from marked paths. If licensed guides refuse a tour, you should take this as an indication of increased risk and refrain from your plan. Do not resist a robbery and, if possible, carry a small amount of money in a separate wallet and possibly a second cell phone with you. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables.

Get medical advice about a hepatitis B vaccination.', 'Diseases transmitted through animal contact': 'Hantavirus infections and leptospirosis are transmitted through contact with infectious rodent excretions. Lassa fever can also be transmitted through contact with bush meat. Infection with rabies occurs through dogs, monkeys and flying foxes and plays a special role due to the proximity of these animals to people. Bird flu can be transmitted through contact with birds and poultry. Poisonous snakes can be found all over the country. Always avoid contact with animals and their excrement. If you are bitten by a dog or a poisonous snake, seek medical attention immediately. Avoid contact with stagnant or slow-moving water, as these may be contaminated with rodent urine.

There are also increasing armed clashes between Indian and Pakistani troops as well as with various separatist groups along the international border and the ceasefire line (LoC). The security situation in the Jammu region is fundamentally stable. However, unpredictable violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces are also possible there. Keep yourself informed about the security and infrastructure situation. Unless absolutely necessary, travel to Srinagar only by air. Do not travel through these areas alone or with an undesignated guide. Do not hitchhike or camp in isolated places. Avoid large gatherings of people. Always follow the instructions of local authorities and security forces. Union Territory of Ladakh The security situation in the Union Territory of Ladakh is fundamentally stable. However, individual terrorist activities cannot be ruled out. In the direct border regions there may be clashes between Indian and Pakistani and Indian and Chinese security forces. Be particularly careful when traveling to the western areas of Ladakh. Get local advice from trustworthy, local guides when selecting trekking routes. Avoid the immediate border areas with Pakistan and the People's Republic of China in Ladakh. Northeast In the northeastern states (Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Nagaland, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Tripura), isolated militant political groups and criminal gangs are still active in some regions. At least so far, tourists have not been the target of attacks or kidnappings, but they can still easily find themselves in danger. In Manipur, since the beginning of May 2023, there have been repeated violent clashes between various ethnic groups and security forces, as well as arson, in the capital Imphal and in rural areas. There were numerous fatalities. Military units were authorized to use firearms (“shoot-on-sight”). The internet was shut down. Postpone travel to Manipur state. If you are in Manipur, exercise extreme caution. When traveling to northeast India, rely on safety-conscious, reliable local partners (tour operators, hotels/resorts, business partners) and behave appropriately to the situation. Please note that some areas require entry permits in addition to the visa. Shortly before your trip, obtain up-to-date information, e.g. from local tour operators on the current security situation and any special permit requirements. Find out if your itinerary passes through areas affected by Naxalite terrorism. Other parts of the country Even protests and demonstrations that are mostly peaceful can lead to violent clashes and traffic disruptions. The states of Bihar, Jharkand, Chhattisgarh, the extreme south-west of Orissa, the extreme north of Andhra Pradesh and the extreme east of Maharashtra record - particularly in rural areas - armed activities of a militant social revolutionary Maoist movement, which has spread in individual districts to the point of being carried out quasi-state violence. The activities have not yet been directed against foreigners; However, there has been a case of kidnapping in the past. Acts of sabotage and attacks on the public railway network have also been carried out in the past. Stay informed about the current security situation and possible planned protests through local media. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces. Do not carry out tourist activities without a local guide who knows the area. Be sure to observe relevant bans from local authorities."", 'crime': 'Petty crime such as pickpocketing occurs. The risk of violent crime is rather low, especially in the tourist areas of India. Tourists in New Delhi and other Indian cities are occasionally, and particularly in central New Delhi, pressured into purchasing overpriced tours by local tour operators using aggressive sales tactics. These offices regularly present themselves as ""state-recognized"" in order to claim special quality and reputation. Local taxi drivers sometimes work with these operators and dubious hoteliers and specifically drive tourists there, especially immediately after they arrive at Delhi airport, using excuses as to why the intended destination cannot be reached. Tourists - especially in Rajasthan and Goa - have repeatedly fallen victim to well-organized con artists, including those offering lucrative jewelry deals. Foreigners, especially women traveling alone or in small groups, are occasionally affected by violent, including sexual, attacks, including in tourist centers. Drugs or knockout drops are sometimes administered through drinks. Always exercise caution and always practice situationally appropriate and culturally aware behavior. This is particularly true for women traveling alone given the reports of sexual assault. When booking travel with Indian travel agencies, be particularly vigilant and check offers submitted. If you find yourself in distress, contact the local police immediately (in Delhi, the special 24-hour Tourist Police, emergency number 100). Keep money, ID cards, driver\'s license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Carry your cell phone concealed and, if possible, not openly in your hand. Only take the cash you need for the day and a credit card to be on the safe side, but no unnecessary valuables. Please exercise normal caution when using credit cards, for example in restaurants, shops, online bookings and at ATMs. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports, train stations, on the subway, on the bus and pay attention to your valuables. Do not leave food and drinks unattended in a restaurant or bar. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.'}","{'General information': 'In particular, the northern parts of the country along the Himalayas are in a very seismically active zone, so earthquakes occur. The climate is monsoon-dependent from July to September. There is a hot dry season from April to June. Northern India experiences more pronounced seasonal changes. During the main monsoon season from July to September, heavy rains repeatedly trigger floods and landslides in large parts of the country. Extensive traffic disruptions, including air traffic, are common during this time. Cyclones and tropical storms are not uncommon on the east coast of India, especially in the months of September to December; in the Bay of Bengal also from April to June. Familiarize yourself with what to do during earthquakes and tsunamis. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.

Roads are often in poor condition. Technical inspections of vehicles, as is common in Central Europe, are not carried out in India and traffic rules are not always observed in the usual way. Serious traffic accidents are particularly common when driving overland. Adequate medical care, especially in emergencies or accidents, cannot be guaranteed in large parts of the country. A reliably functioning rescue service does not exist everywhere, even in cities. Walkways often do not exist or pose significant risks of accidents such as unexpected tripping hazards or unsecured or marked construction pits. Even small accidents can lead to the interference of bystanders and arguments. Exercise caution in traffic. If possible, avoid driving overland in the dark. Always behave defensively and reservedly.

The length of authorized stay varies between the different e-visa categories (e.g. tourism, business, or conference visas). Indianvisaonline provides more detailed information, which can also be used to submit applications. In individual cases there are said to be difficulties when paying for e-TV online. A printout of the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) must be presented upon request. A 24/7 helpline is available at +91-11-2430 0666 or indiatvoa@gov.in. Regular tourist visas are generally issued with a validity period of 365 days from the date of issue and entitle you to stay up to 90 days per visit. As a rule, multiple entries are possible (multiple entry visa). Expulsions continue to occur because, according to the Indian authorities, activities in India such as NGO work or journalism are not compatible with tourist visa status. When applying for the e-Visa via Indianvisaonline, ensure that the payment has actually been made and always carry a printout of the Electronic Travel Authorization (ETA) with you. Always apply for specific reason-related visas, e.g. conference visas, journalist visas or business/employment/entry (X) visas for volunteer work. Find out more about tourist and work visas from the Indian Ministry of Interior or Bureau of Immigration (FAQ Tourist Visa and FAQ Employment Visa). Extension/overstay of stay An extension of the validity of the tourist visa after entry is only possible in justified exceptional/emergency cases by the responsible local Foreigners' Regional Registration Office (FRRO). Travelers who do not leave within the validity of the visa must expect a prison sentence and an entry ban for several years. Registration If the intended total period of stay is more than six months or if such a requirement is listed in the Indian visa (e.g. work visa), there is an obligation to register with the locally responsible District Foreigners' Registration Office (FRO) or .at the Foreigners' Regional Registration Office (FRRO), which must be done within 14 days of arrival. Failure to register regularly means that departure at the Indian airport is prevented and a separate exit permit must be obtained from the locally responsible FRRO, so that a return journey to the last place of stay within India and thus a delay in departure for several days becomes unavoidable. For longer stays or corresponding requirements, register with the responsible FRRO within 14 days of entry. For stays of more than 180 days with a business or employment visa, carry a tax clearance certificate with you. Entry control Passports are not always stamped by the border authorities upon entry. Without an entry stamp, there will be considerable difficulties when leaving the country. Delays of several days due to the acquisition of an exit permit from the FRO and Ministry of Home Affairs (only in Delhi) are the rule. This also applies in the event of a passport being lost during your stay in India and a replacement document being required to be issued by the responsible German mission abroad. Be sure to get an entry stamp. Surrogacy India does not issue visas to foreigners who want to enter the country to carry out surrogacy. Surrogacy is prohibited in Germany.

In particular, pregnant women and their partners as well as couples who are planning to become pregnant are recommended to take all-day exposure prophylaxis when traveling to Kannur and to use condoms during sexual intercourse during and after the trip. Pregnant women should critically consider the need to travel. After traveling to the outbreak area, contraception should be used for the rest of the pregnancy. Couples who want to have children should use contraception for three months after returning from travel, as Zika virus excretion via semen can occur over this period, see Zika virus infection.', 'Vaccination protection': ""No compulsory vaccinations are required for direct entry from Germany.

Please note the application instructions and help for the indication in the travel vaccination recommendations. The DTG offers current, detailed travel vaccination recommendations for professionals."", 'Nipah Virus Infection': 'The Nipah virus (NiV) has its reservoir in certain flying fox species in Southeast Asia. Since 1999, local and temporary outbreaks have occurred repeatedly in the state of Kerala. The virus can be transmitted, among other things, through direct contact with infected flying foxes or indirectly via contaminated fruit, including palm sap, to both pigs and humans, who then become ill. In recent outbreaks, however, only close physical contact was responsible for transmission from person to person; especially when caring for sick people in hospitals or in the same household. Blood, urine and secretions from the respiratory tract (droplet infection) from sick people are infectious, among other things. Since there is neither a vaccination nor a causal therapy against NiV available for humans, prevention is limited to avoiding contact with infected or sick animals and patients as well as products contaminated by them. Avoid direct contact with fruit bats or indirectly contaminated fruits, including palm sap.', 'Zika virus infection': 'The infection with Zika viruses, which is primarily transmitted by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes, can lead to malformations in children during pregnancy and cause neurological complications in adults. Several outbreaks have already been detected in India, most recently in Uttar Pradesh in 2021. Please follow the recommendations for your trip, see Zika virus infection.', 'Dengue fever': 'Dengue viruses are transmitted nationwide by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches. In rare cases, serious complications, including possible death, occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see dengue fever. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis. Get advice from tropical and/or travel doctors regarding vaccination.', 'Chikungunya fever': 'Chikungunya viruses are transmitted by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes, increasingly during and immediately after the rainy season and particularly in populated coastal areas and large metropolises. The disease is characterized by high fever and possibly prolonged joint and muscle pain. The symptoms often cannot be clearly distinguished from other mosquito-borne diseases. Chikungunya fever does not always heal without consequences; long-lasting rheumatism-like symptoms rarely occur. There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see also Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. Except at altitudes above 2000 m in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu, Kashmir and Sikkim, there is a risk of malaria transmission throughout the year in India. There is a high risk in the eastern and northeastern areas below 2,000 m. There is a medium risk below 2,000 m in other areas in the east and northeast as well as in the Nicobar Islands. There is a low risk in the other areas below 2,000 m, including New Delhi, Calcutta, Mumbai, Rajasthan and the Andaman Islands. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. When traveling to areas with a medium risk of malaria that are more than 48 hours away from the nearest medical facility with the possibility of malaria diagnosis and treatment, it is recommended to take appropriate medication with you for emergency self-treatment.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. In India, the number of infections, mainly through heterosexual sexual intercourse, has increased significantly in recent years. Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrheal diseases are common throughout the country all year round, see Diarrheal diseases. Even in cities, tap water is often not of drinking water quality. The risk of infection\xa0from salmonella, shigella, amoeba, lamblia and worm diseases, hepatitis A and E exists nationwide. Many typhus germs are multi-resistant, i.e. antibiotics are only poorly effective. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Japanese encephalitis': 'Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an inflammation of the brain caused by viruses. These are transmitted by nocturnal mosquitoes. Pigs and waterfowl in particular are infected with the virus without becoming ill themselves. Diseases in humans are usually asymptomatic, but in rare cases they can be severe and cause permanent damage or be fatal. There are no effective medications against JE viruses. A low risk of transmission of JE exists nationwide, particularly in rural areas. In the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar there are frequent occurrences of encephalitis and meningitis, the cause of which cannot always be clearly clarified and which is attributed to various pathogens. To avoid Japanese encephalitis, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially at night, as part of exposure prophylaxis, and seek advice regarding vaccination.', 'Flu (Seasonal Influenza)': 'The seasonal influenza viruses, including the new influenza A/H1N1 (swine flu), circulate in the Indian subcontinent\xa0predominantly during and just after the monsoon season.

The necessary medical measures after bite injuries in unvaccinated people are not always possible in India outside of the big cities, e.g. on the trekking routes in the north, and an uninterrupted cold chain for vaccines is not guaranteed everywhere, see rabies. Vaccination against rabies is particularly important for travelers to India. Please seek advice from a travel or tropical medicine specialist in this regard. Avoid contact with stray animals. Don't feed monkeys. Even if you have already been vaccinated, consult a doctor immediately after contact with a potentially infected animal or person (bite, licking of injured skin areas or droplets of saliva on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes)."", 'Tuberculosis': 'Tuberculosis is much more common nationwide than in Central Europe. Transmission occurs from person to person via droplet infection or close contact. Due to improper or discontinued treatments, there are increasing numbers of resistant and multi-resistant tuberculosis pathogens.', 'Geographically related diseases': 'North India is a popular destination for trekkers who climb to high altitudes. There is often not enough time for gradual height adjustment. Various forms of acute altitude sickness are possible, see altitude sickness. Before traveling to high altitudes (above 2,300 m), seek individual advice from a doctor experienced in high-altitude medicine before finalizing your travel plans. Travel health insurance that covers the risk of mountains (e.g. helicopter evacuation) is strongly recommended. Intense sunlight, glare from snow and ice, strong winds, extreme cold and impassable or unknown terrain pose additional risks for travelers at high altitudes. Earthquakes or persistent rainfall can cause avalanches, mudslides and entire mountain slopes to slide in vulnerable areas. There are no civil air rescue companies in India for helicopter rescue from mountain emergencies, only the option of evacuation by the Indian military, which is very bureaucratic and time-consuming. Depending on the location of the accident, the alarm can often only be triggered with a very long delay; the use of satellite phones is strictly prohibited in India. Despite great time pressure due to the need to obtain approvals from various government agencies, it can sometimes take several days, especially on weekends, until a search party or a helicopter is ready for action. Due to the weather, the aircraft are not always ready for use and can usually only take off early in the morning within a very narrow time window. In any case, the assumption of costs for a rescue must be clarified before the start of the rescue operation and is usually initially borne by the injured person. In the south of the country, solar radiation is particularly intense because of the proximity to the equator. Unpleasant and long-term dangerous sunburns are common. Make sure you use good sun protection and drink enough fluids, especially for children and the elderly. Dangerous currents often lead to swimming accidents on the coast. Warnings on the beaches must be heeded. Children should never play unsupervised on beaches. Beaches contaminated by animal feces pose a risk of infection with parasitic skin diseases (larva migrans cutanea).', 'Air pollution': ""Air pollution in cities has increased significantly in recent years. In all Indian metropolises there is also a high level of air pollution from combustion residues and smoke in the winter months. This can significantly worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma or COPD. Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index as well as the smartphone app AirVisual or the Delhi state government's measuring stations page."", 'Medical care': 'Medical care, especially in emergencies or accidents, is inadequate in large parts of the country and usually does not meet European standards in terms of medical, hygiene, technology and organization. A reliably functioning rescue service does not exist everywhere, even in cities. Language barriers can make communication significantly more difficult, especially in rural areas. In the big cities, medical care in all specialist disciplines is usually at a high and very high level and is therefore significantly more expensive. In the case of serious illnesses, medical evacuation to one of the large urban clinics may have to be considered. It is customary there to pay a significant deposit before treatment begins. The supply of reliable medication and an uninterrupted cold chain are not guaranteed everywhere. It must be expected that counterfeit products will be sold instead of real medication, especially in small pharmacies. The pharmacies of large private clinics offer a wide range of reliable medications. Numerous resistances to commonly used antibiotics are occurring across the country. The German representations in India provide information on local medical care. If necessary, discuss your travel plans in detail with your doctor. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go. Patients with mental illnesses are advised not to stop taking their medication before or during a trip to India. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG.

When staying in areas at risk of earthquakes or tsunamis and before hiking or climbing a volcano, familiarize yourself with the dangers and precautions. The German Research Center for Geosciences has relevant information sheets available. The International Volcanic Health Hazard Network IVHHN also offers advice on what to do during a volcanic eruption. Be sure to follow the relevant information from the Indonesian government. Climate, floods, forest fires The climate is tropical and humid. Large parts of the country are affected by heavy rain, floods and landslides during the rainy season, which usually lasts from November to March, which can result in persistent flooding and significant traffic disruptions. Power supplies and telephone and internet connections may also be significantly affected. During the dry season, forest fires occur again and again, especially on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan (Borneo), which regularly cause air pollution that is harmful to health. Always pay attention to local weather forecasts, exclusion zones, prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as instructions from local authorities. In the event of a storm warning, please note the information on hurricanes abroad or the information from the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance.""}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'The transport infrastructure in Indonesia does not meet European standards. Road, sea and air traffic are prone to accidents. Traffic routes are further impaired in many parts of the country following natural disasters and increasing floods in the rainy season. It is not uncommon for fatal accidents involving foreigners to occur. The safety precautions in shipping and ferry traffic do not meet European standards. There is left-hand traffic. Motorways hardly exist. Due to the unfamiliar traffic situation for foreigners, motorcycle accidents often occur, especially in Bali and Lombok. Trekking tours, mountain climbs and diving should be carried out with local guides. For all activities, always take with you money (cash and credit cards), food and water, mobile devices that are as fully charged as possible and any necessary medication in sufficient quantities, but also in moderation - to avoid the impression of drug smuggling. Only rent cars from reputable companies and with a driver; Make sure you have adequate comprehensive and liability insurance coverage.

In the eastern province of Aceh, parts of Sharia law apply to both Muslims and non-Muslim travelers. Homosexual relationships, gambling, drinking alcohol or having sex outside of marriage can be punished with caning. The same applies to varying degrees in some of the neighboring areas. With the exception of Bali, Indonesia is a predominantly Islamic country. The general rules of conduct that apply to travelers (especially women) in Islamic countries should therefore be observed (except in Bali), especially in rural areas of Indonesia. During the fasting month of Ramadan, restrictions in everyday life can be expected in Islamic parts of the country (e.g. closure of restaurants outside hotels during the day, reduced working hours at authorities) and increased sensitivity in religious matters and in relation to compliance with Islamic traditions. Even if the fasting rules only apply to Muslims, non-Muslims should also be careful not to hurt religious feelings. You should therefore refrain from eating, drinking and smoking in public during the day and wear discreet, long-sleeved clothing.', 'LGBTIQ': 'Homosexuality is not prohibited in Indonesia, with the exception of Aceh province, but operators and guests of LGBTIQ facilities and events are repeatedly prosecuted on the basis of anti-pornography legislation. You can find further information on the criminal liability of sexual acts under Legal Particulars. Even in provinces where same-sex sexual acts are not punishable, they are hardly tolerated by society. Acceptance is higher in the capital Jakarta and Bali than in rural areas. The rise of religious-conservative forces in some parts of the country has led to declining tolerance towards social minorities. Sexual minorities can be particularly affected by this. Please note the general information for LGBTIQ.', 'Legal specifics': 'Indonesia is one of the countries with the strictest drug laws in the world. Possessing even the smallest amount of drugs (even in the transit area of \u200b\u200bairports) often leads to long prison sentences and even the death penalty, which is also carried out on foreigners. We therefore strongly warn against the acquisition, possession, distribution, import and export of drugs. Even medications for personal use, especially if they contain narcotics, such as methadone, or psychotropic drugs, can be classified as drugs without proof of the appropriate prescription and lead to corresponding consequences. Taking or transporting items for third parties without knowing the contents can have disastrous consequences. Sexual abuse of children is a criminal offense and is also punishable under German law if these acts are committed by Germans abroad. Indonesian court and investigation procedures do not meet German constitutional standards. If violations of Indonesian laws are suspected, you may have to expect long pre-trial detention, expensive and yet sometimes inadequate legal defense, and prison conditions that are hazardous to health. Even if minor offenses are suspected, such as: B. damage to property, foreigners, especially in Bali, are often taken into custody by the Indonesian police. In 2022, the new criminal law was passed in Indonesia, according to which, among other things, extramarital sex can be punished with up to one year in prison. Only close relatives of those affected and their spouses are entitled to report. The law is scheduled to come into force in 2025. Due to the autonomous status of Aceh Province, the criminal law there differs from the rest of Indonesia. By introducing individual elements of Islamic criminal law, acts such as gambling, alcohol consumption, extramarital sex or homosexual relationships are punishable there. These penal provisions also apply to non-Muslims. The possible punishment may include drastic physical measures (public corporal punishment).', 'Money/credit cards': 'The local currency is Rupiah (IDR). Paying with credit cards is widespread.

Unnecessary travel to the Kurdistan-Iraq region is not recommended due to the unstable security situation.', 'terrorism': 'The terrorist organization IS has no longer exercised territorial control in Iraq since the end of 2017. However, there are still groups of fighters in the country who continue to pose a threat. Serious attacks and open armed clashes between terrorist groups and security forces must continue to be expected across the country. The security situation throughout Iraq remains volatile. The number of terrorist attacks, especially in northern and central Iraq, has long been very high. Persons in Iraq should closely monitor media reports and take all precautions to leave at short notice if necessary. The provinces of Anbar, Diyala, Kirkuk, Ninewa (Sinjar, Mosul, border with Syria), Salah Al-Din and the north of Babel Province are particularly dangerous. Serious attacks and open armed clashes between IS and Iraqi security forces must continue to be expected in these provinces. In the northern province of Ninewa there are repeated clashes between security forces and PKK-affiliated forces, which also affect civilians. The same applies to the northern border of the Kurdistan-Iraq region with Syria and Turkey. There have been attacks on the Turkish military and Turkish air strikes on PKK positions here. There are also isolated clashes on the border of the Kurdistan-Iraq region with Iran. The basis of every trip to areas with travel warnings should be a viable, professional security concept. Elements of a professional security concept can include, in particular, the use of specially protected vehicles, the deployment of an appropriate number of security forces and professional advice from security personnel after preliminary information and planning of the route. Follow local and social media. Avoid centralized infrastructure at this time. US facilities are particularly at risk. Avoid demonstrations if you are in Iraq despite the partial travel warning. Follow the instructions of security guards. Capital Baghdad Despite an improvement in the security situation in the capital Baghdad, the risk of serious attacks remains, particularly on Iraqi security institutions and their members, on ministries, hotels, public places and religious institutions. There is also a high risk of kidnappings with a terrorist or criminal background. The security situation remains volatile. Individual sections of the capital Baghdad are particularly secured by Iraqi security forces, including Baghdad International Airport. But attacks cannot be ruled out there either. In the past, the so-called International Zone and immediately adjacent areas have repeatedly been the target of mortar and rocket fire, and this danger continues. Protests and violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces may occur in the urban area, particularly around Tahrir Square and the three Tigris bridges, Jumhuriya, Sinak and al-Ahrar. The protests are partially restricting freedom of movement in the city. Further outbreaks of violence in connection with the demonstrations cannot be ruled out. Be sure to avoid demonstrations and crowds of people. Kurdistan-Iraq Region The security situation in the Kurdistan-Iraq region (Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaimaniyah/Halabja provinces) is tense. Due to the highly volatile situation in the Middle East, further developments in the security situation are difficult to predict. There is a continued increased risk of terrorist attacks (Dohuk, Erbil and Sulaimaniyah/Halabja provinces). If travel to the region is nevertheless absolutely necessary, this requires a careful examination of the current local security situation and appropriate security measures. The local host or relevant authorities and companies can usually provide practical information on the type and extent of such security measures.

If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a low seasonal risk of malaria in Iraq from May to November in the northeast of the country below 1,500 m altitude. However, no locally acquired cases have been reported since 2009. Due to the political situation and possibly limited surveillance, the current situation is difficult to assess. Sporadic cases are possible. DTG provides country information. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Drug prevention (chemoprophylaxis) is currently not recommended.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'The prevalence of HIV in the population is very low. However, there is a general risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is endemic in Iraq. The last outbreak with several thousand sick people occurred in the summer of 2015 near Baghdad. The disease is transmitted via inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Crimean-Congo fever': 'Crimean-Congo fever is a widespread viral disease that also occurs in Iraq and can be associated with an increased tendency to bleeding (hemorrhagic fever). As a rule, the disease is transmitted to humans through direct contact with blood or meat of infected domestic animals (e.g. cows, sheep, goats, camels) or through a tick bite. Therapy is primarily symptomatic; The virus-inhibiting drug ribavirin is said to have a positive effect. There is no vaccination. The risk for tourists is extremely low. Pay attention to protection against tick bites (clothing that covers the body, sturdy shoes). Be careful when handling raw meat and when dealing with sick people.', 'MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)': 'This infectious disease has been causing isolated, severe respiratory illnesses in countries on the Arabian Peninsula since 2012. The cause is a coronavirus (MERS-CoV), whose biology has not been conclusively clarified. Camels appear to be involved in transmission to humans. Transmission from person to person only occurred through very close contact with sick people, see MERS. Avoid unnecessary contact with camels.', 'Other infectious diseases': 'Schistosomiasis is endemic in some regions of Iraq. Avoid contact with fresh water there. Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, echinococcosis and rabies can occur nationwide.', 'Air pollution': 'Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual.', 'Medical care': 'The level of care in large parts of the country is neither technically nor humanly sufficient. In the capital Baghdad, the privately managed Baghdad Diplomatic Support Center is available to diplomatic missions. However, a prior contract conclusion is required to use it. The St. Raphael Hospital can be named as the best private local hospital, although it does not have essential care options such as cardiac catheterization, neurosurgery and a modern intensive care unit. In Iraq, not all medications are consistently available or the safe origin of the medication is guaranteed. A sufficient amount of long-term medication should therefore be carried with you. The Kurdish autonomous areas in the north are an exception. Comparatively better care is guaranteed there. However, Western European standards are often not achieved there either. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG.

German citizens are asked to leave Iran.', 'terrorism': ""In Iran, incidents with a terrorist background occur irregularly, especially in border regions. The provinces of Kurdistan and Sistan-Baluchistan, the east of Kerman province and the border areas with Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan are particularly affected. At least 16 people were killed in two attacks on a Shiite shrine in the city of Shiraz in 2022 and 2023. The Iranian authorities have recently increased general security measures in the border area with Iraq and Pakistan, but also in the capital Tehran. There is a significant risk of kidnapping and attacks in the east of Kerman province and in Sistan-Baluchistan province and generally in Iran's border areas with Pakistan and Afghanistan, especially in the triangle between the cities of Zabol, Bam and Chabahar. The situation in the port city of Chabahar itself is more stable. However, attacks have not yet been directed against foreign nationals. In the province of Sistan-Baluchestan (southeast, border with Pakistan/Afghanistan), there are regular conflicts between Iranian security forces and armed groups. Freedom of movement is restricted and there are increased security and personal checks. Foreign nationals were repeatedly detained in the region and subjected to lengthy interrogations. In some cases, onward travel was only possible with Iranian police escort. This happened against the background of frequent cases of armed attacks on Iranian security forces in the region for years. In the province of Kurdistan and the province of West Azerbaijan, which is also inhabited by Kurds, there have been repeated attacks against security forces, judicial personnel and members of the clergy. In this context, security forces have once again increased their actions against Kurdish separatist groups and controls with checkpoints. According to Iranian sources, since 2015 there have been repeated arrests of people in Khuzestan province and other parts of the country, including Tehran, who are linked to the so-called Islamic State and are said to have planned terrorist attacks in Iran. Traveling to the border regions with Armenia and Azerbaijan is not recommended even after the end of the military conflict between the two countries in connection with the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Please note the current travel warning and request to leave Iran for all German citizens. For the border regions with Iraq and Pakistan, always pay attention to the current situation in neighboring countries. Avoid traveling to the east of Kerman Province and Sistan-Baluchistan as well as to the immediate border areas with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Avoid non-essential travel to the Kurdish areas of the northwest and the borders with Armenia and Azerbaijan. Use the air to travel to the port city of Chabahar. Be particularly careful in busy places and on special occasions. Please note the global safety notice."", 'Domestic political situation': ""Please note the information under News. Since the death of the young Iranian woman Jina Mahsa Amini on September 16, 2022, the security situation in the country has been tense. (Spontaneous) protests may continue to occur due to the ongoing repression by the security forces. Police and security forces can use violence against demonstrators. This particularly affects provinces with a high proportion of ethno-religious minorities (e.g. Sistan-Baluchistan, Kurdistan). In the vicinity of demonstrations, protesters and also uninvolved foreign nationals can be arbitrarily arrested. Communication services are largely restricted (especially mobile internet, Instagram, WhatsApp, VPNs). In the past, German travelers who had close contact with Iranian nationals through couch surfing or other private overnight stays were arrested for violating Muslim morals and/or suspected security threats. Close contact between foreign and Iranian nationals may also place the Iranian nationals involved in serious danger. Entry and stay in Iran for a purpose other than that stated on the Iranian visa may be punishable by law. See travel information – special precautions. During protests and rallies, security forces may use excessive force and make arbitrary arrests. Internet services, especially social media and telephone networks, may be temporarily switched off. People who intentionally or accidentally find themselves in the vicinity of demonstrations are at risk of arrest and conviction. All foreigners, and in particular people who also have Iranian citizenship, are at increased risk of being arrested or rejected when entering or leaving the country, even without any apparent reason. Iranian authorities do not recognize dual nationality, but treat Iranian dual nationals as if they were exclusively Iranian nationals. Consular support options from the German Embassy in Tehran are significantly limited or even impossible, see also Entry and Customs - German-Iranian dual nationals and current s. In the past, German travelers who had close contact with Iranian nationals through couch surfing or other private forms of overnight accommodation were arrested for violating Muslim morals and/or suspected security threats. Close contact between foreign and Iranian nationals may also place the Iranian nationals involved in serious danger. Entry and stay in Iran for a purpose other than that stated on the Iranian visa may be punishable by law. See travel information – special precautions. Please note the current travel warning and request to leave Iran for all German citizens. The security situation can change quickly and unpredictably across the country. If you are still in the country, be very careful and avoid large-scale demonstrations and gatherings of people. Avoid intensive contact with Iranian nationals. You can put yourself and others in serious danger. Avoid couch surfing or other forms of private accommodation organized via social networks. Use your visa only for the purpose stated therein. Visa abuse can have serious consequences, including arrest and conviction\xa0or deportation. Overall, only take photographs and film very restrictively and only with the permission of the people being photographed, see Safety – Photographing and filming. Avoid statements about political conditions and events in Iran. Follow the current political situation during your stay and find out about current developments via the local media or in your accommodation. Follow the instructions of local security forces. Find out about Iranian holidays. Be particularly careful on the following dates: February 11th - Revolutionary Day Ghods Day - (exact date changes annually) September 16th - Mahsa Amini's death anniversary November 4th - Occupation of the US Embassy December 7th - so-called Student Day. Border region with Afghanistan and Pakistan The situation on the Iranian-Afghan border is confusing. Arrests, imprisonment and deportations to Afghanistan are possible, particularly for people who have Afghan nationality or other roots in the region. Even before the protests over the death of Mahsa Amini, the security situation in the border region with Pakistan, especially in the Sistan-Baluchistan province, was extremely tense. The same applies to theSecurity situation in Iran's border areas with Pakistan. Please note the information under safety and the current travel warning for Afghanistan.

The same applies to landscape photos in certain regions. When and where bans apply is often not clear. Photographing and filming even seemingly harmless places can lead to arrests and prosecution on charges of espionage – see current news. Under no circumstances should the following be photographed or filmed: Government institutions or buildings or government vehicles Military installations or military maneuvers Nuclear power plants, refineries, oil/gas production facilities, drilling platforms Crowds of people or demonstrations Personnel of official authorities (e.g. police or military) Embassy buildings Critical (utility) infrastructure such as Electricity or waterworks Individuals without their express consent Do not take photos and videos in front of and in airports, train stations and similar buildings. Under no circumstances should you use drones, even in remote areas outside of cities. Take photos and film very restrictively. You can always face suspicion of espionage. Prison sentences of several years are possible."", 'Landmines': 'Landmines are to be expected in the areas on the Iran-Iraq border (especially in the western Iranian provinces of Kermanshah, Khuzestan, West Azerbaijan, Kurdistan and Ilam) as a result of the Iran-Iraq War (1980-1988). In the past there have been repeated incidents that often ended in death. Uninhabited areas should be avoided in these regions and paved paths should under no circumstances be left. Avoid uninhabited areas in the border region with Iraq and never leave the paved paths. There is a risk of landmines.', 'crime': ""The crime rate is generally low by international standards, but pickpocketing and handbag snatchings occur again and again, especially by passing motorcyclists. Cell phones are also snatched as people drive past, both on the street and out of vehicle windows. There are cases in which alleged security personnel carry out identity checks. Valuables are retained during such a “check” and stolen in this way. Vehicle thefts particularly affect those with four-wheel drive such as SUVs. There have been isolated cases of sexual harassment in the past, particularly in crowded and remote areas. Avoid traveling at night or alone in remote areas. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports, train stations, on the subway, on the bus and pay attention to your valuables. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Always carry a copy of your passport and e-visa with you. Leave your passport and visa in a safe place during the day. Only take the cash you need for the day and no valuables you don't need. Keep windows and doors closed when traveling by car and prefer pre-booked taxis to those on the street. As a woman traveling alone, do not stay in deserted areas, e.g. far away from the regularly frequented hiking routes in the mountains. Avoid crowds of people. Find out about the Iranian concept of “Taroof” - don't accept every polite offer of hospitality without understanding what it means. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any personal information, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'Iran lies in a very seismically active zone. Earthquakes of varying magnitude are expected in most parts of the country. The climate is dry continental with mild winters, with the exception of the mountains in the north. Only on the Gulf Coast is it humid and hot. Avalanches and landslides can occur in the mountains. Caution is advised, especially in the winter season. Continued heavy rain can lead to widespread flooding and disruption to travel. In some parts of the country, dust and sand storms can occur all year round. Follow weather reports regularly and stay away from river banks during heavy rain. Always stay on the designated paths and slopes and do not leave them. Remember the risk of avalanches and landslides in the mountains. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Familiarize yourself with what to do in the event of an earthquake. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'International flights from Tehran are handled via Imam Khomeini Airport (IKA), which is located outside the city. The centrally located Mehrabad Airport (THR) is only used for domestic flights. The infrastructure in the country is good. The internal Iranian flight network is narrow; all major cities in the country can be reached by plane. The train and bus connections, including night trains (sleeping cars), are comparable to European standards. The road network is well developed. Within cities, it is recommended to use taxis (also via apps from private ride service providers such as “Snapp” or “TAP30”) or the metro. The number of road deaths, particularly among motorcyclists (and their passengers), has remained consistently high in Iran for years. The behavior of many road users is unpredictable. Many vehicles are poorly maintained (lights, brakes, tires, seat belts are often not present), which further increases the risk of accidents. At Iranian gas stations you can usually only get low-quality gasoline and super with a low octane rating. Diesel is only available at a few gas stations and only outside the big cities, as private diesel vehicles are not driven in Iran. The quality of diesel is often poor and some gas stations refuse to sell it to private foreign drivers. As a rule, a separate fuel card is required, which should be purchased when crossing the border. Be careful on the road, especially as a pedestrian and when using two-wheeled vehicles. When driving, especially at night, pay attention to bumps in the road to reduce speed. Be sure to pay attention to signs about restricted military areas, even if certain roads may be shown as passable on maps. Avoid desert tours.', ""Driver's license"": 'Driving in Iran is possible for up to six months with a German driving license. The international driving license is only valid in conjunction with the national German driving license.', 'LGBTIQ': 'Homosexual acts are punishable (as are sexual acts outside of marriage in general). In some cases, homosexual acts are punishable by death.

The three islands are claimed by both the UAE and Iran. Foreign boat crews who approached the islands from the UAE side have been arrested and sentenced to prison by the Iranian side on charges of “violating Iranian territorial waters and illegal immigration.” Avoid independent boat or ship trips in the Strait of Hormuz due to the very politically sensitive situation.', 'Special behavioral instructions': 'The applicable Iranian laws and moral values, in particular the Islamic clothing regulations, should be strictly observed, see also legal particulars. Photos and video recordings should only be taken very restrictively and only with the permission of the people involved, see Safety – taking photos and filming. Foreign nationals have also been accused and convicted because of their statements on current political issues via telephone, social media and similar, see also News - Arrests, rejections and increased risks for individual tourism, as well as Legal particularities. Many websites, apps and especially social media (e.g. Facebook) as well as some email providers are blocked in Iran and can only be used via VPN. Using unauthorized VPNs is a criminal offense. Iranian nationals are banned from contact with numerous Western organizations and media. They were also asked not to have contact with foreign nationals, foreign embassies and organizations working with them “beyond the normal level”. This could result in arrests of both German and Iranian nationals. The validity of the Iranian visa should be strictly observed. If it expires during your stay in Iran, the responsible immigration police can extend it. If the visa has already expired, the Iranian immigration police must also be visited before leaving the country and any fines must be paid. The required exit visa can then be drawn up. Further information about the exit visa can be found on the website of the German Embassy in Tehran. Be sure to respect the applicable laws and moral values, especially the Islamic clothing regulations, see also legal details. Do not exceed the validity of your visa. Use your visa only for the entry purpose stated on the visa. Visa misuse can result in passport revocation, imprisonment or deportation. Be aware of possible surveillance of technical communication channels and do not send photos or travel reports related to current political developments. The same applies to text messages and phone calls. Be prepared for blocked access to many foreign websites and apps. Avoid “couch surfing” or other forms of private accommodation offered via social networks. Both you and your Iranian host face the possibility of passport revocation, legal proceedings and/or imprisonment.', 'Ramadan': 'The date of the Islamic fasting month varies from year to year and is not the same as the dates in force in the Arab world. During this time of religious reflection, members of the Muslim faith are required to fast, which means abstaining from food, drink, smoking and other sensual pleasures from sunrise to sunset. Eating, drinking and smoking in public are prohibited during the day, even for people of other faiths or non-beliefs. Exceptions apply to pregnant women, sick people, children and travelers. Expect restrictions in everyday life (closure of many restaurants during the day, reduced working hours at government offices) and increased sensitivity in religious matters as well as in matters related to respect for Islamic traditions. Respect the religious feelings of the local population and treat fasting with respect, even if you are a person of different faiths or non-beliefs.', 'Legal specifics': 'Iranian authorities do not recognize dual nationality. They treat people who also have Iranian nationality as if they were exclusively Iranian nationals, see current news. Actions that are punishable according to Western legal understanding are also punished by the courts in Iran. In addition, actions that are not problematic according to Western legal understanding but can violate Muslim values \u200b\u200b(for example dancing) can be punished. The punishments imposed are often severe and often incompatible with Western legal understanding. Physical punishment (e.g. lashes) is possible. The prison conditions are very harsh. The death penalty can be imposed for serious drug crimes, murder, armed robbery, serious financial crimes and certain sexual acts (sexual intercourse outside of marriage, same-sex sexual intercourse). Violations of the Narcotics Act are punished with long prison sentences for even the smallest amounts and any type of drug. Possession, consumption and importation of alcohol are prohibited. The Islamic clothing regulations apply to women (from the age of nine) and men: the coat for women (called manteau) must cover the female body shape. Hair and neck must be covered with a headscarf. Arms and legs must be covered up to the wrists and ankles respectively. Men must wear long pants, but short-sleeved T-shirts are accepted. However, long shirts must be worn in religious places such as mosques. Checks for correct clothing are increasingly being carried out, especially in religiously important cities such as Mashhad or Qom, but also repeatedly in Tehran. Women should not ride motorcycles for legal reasons. When dealing with Iranian women or men in public, police checks must be expected. Conspicuous behavior or the use of technical devices such as conspicuous cameras, GPS devices and drones can also lead to controls and quickly lead to accusations of espionage. Simply staying near military or nuclear facilities can lead to serious misunderstandings and even accusations of espionage. The use of VPN networks is controlled; using an unauthorized VPN network is punishable. Violations of the Endangered Species Agreement are strictly prosecuted by the Ministry of the Environment and can result in prison sentences of up to three years. Be sure to observe the laws and rules that apply to the relationship between men and women. Avoid “couch surfing” or other forms of private accommodation offered via social networks. Both you and your Iranian host may face loss of passport, legal action or imprisonment. Refrain from importing or using drones. Avoid using VPN services.

The Iranian diplomatic missions in Germany, such as the Iranian embassy in Berlin, provide information on visas. The visa can be applied for online at the responsible diplomatic missions before entering the country. The visa is not stuck into the passport, but is issued as an electronic visa that is carried in the form of a printout. This also eliminates the need to affix an entry stamp in the passport. Keep your passport and visa safe throughout your stay. For non-tourist stays in Iran, the correct visa (e.g. journalist visa, work visa) must be applied for. If you violate Iranian entry regulations, you must expect criminal prosecution and disproportionately high penalties (including several years in prison). If the validity of the visa is exceeded or the passport is lost, significant difficulties can be expected. The issuance of an exit visa (“exit visa”) by the Iranian authorities can take several days to weeks. If the visa period is exceeded, fines are usually due to the immigration police as well as a processing fee for the exit visa. Find out more about what to do if your German passport is lost or expires and the steps to apply for an Iranian exit visa on the website of the German Embassy in Tehran. Visa before entry An online visa (e-Visa) can be applied for to enter Iran before entry. Depending on the purpose of the trip, the fees are between EUR 35 and EUR 90; an express visa is also possible for a surcharge of 50%. The processing time (except for press visas) is 7 to 14 days. Visa upon entry (“on arrival”) Whether it is possible in individual cases to apply for a visa upon entry at Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport (IKA) can only be clarified by prior contact with the responsible Iranian diplomatic mission in Germany and the airline. Before starting your journey, a reference number should be generated via the website of the Iranian embassy in Berlin in order to speed up the visa issuance at the airport. Applying for a visa at the airport without a reference number is possible, but may be time-consuming. Proof of health insurance and an invitation with the name, address and telephone number of the inviter or the hotel booking confirmation should be taken with you. Depending on the volume, the processing process can take a few hours and a rejection of the visa application and deportation to Germany cannot be ruled out. In addition, visas issued upon entry generally cannot be extended. It is therefore preferable to apply for a visa before entering the country. Find out from the Iranian diplomatic missions in Germany which steps are necessary for the visa-on-arrival process. You should also find out from your airline whether they will transport you without a visa issued before entry. Health insurance Iranian or German accident and health insurance is necessary for the duration of your stay in Iran. The Iranian diplomatic missions abroad are obliged to check health insurance coverage before issuing the visa. When applying for a visa in Germany, proof of the existence of appropriate insurance must therefore be provided by presenting an insurance contract. Proof of health insurance that includes COVID-19 illness is often required. Please contact the Iranian diplomatic missions in Germany to find out the exact requirements for your international health insurance. Border crossings for entry and exit Foreign nationals can generally enter the country via the country's international airports in accordance with the applicable requirements. The border crossings into Pakistan are located in the Sistan-Baluschistan province, where clashes between demonstrators and security forces as well as gang crime (especially drug smuggling), accompanied by attacks and the use of firearms, have been recorded. A sea crossing from Iranian ports on the Persian Gulf to the UAE is strongly discouraged as it may involve illegal ferry and freight connections. All immigration, customs and foreign exchange forms should be completed carefully and accurately. Those arriving overland with their own vehicle need Iranian vehicle insurance for their vehicle.

Onward travel to neighboring countries S. Partial travel warning for Pakistan. To apply for a visa for some of Iran's neighboring countries (e.g. Pakistan, Turkmenistan) in Iran, the relevant foreign missions often require a consular certificate confirming the traveler's passport details. The German Embassy in Tehran can only issue such a certificate when traveling to Pakistan if a booked flight ticket can be presented.

This means that consular support from the German Embassy in Tehran is hardly possible in emergencies. Iranian citizenship cannot be renounced and Iran automatically views children of Iranian parents as Iranians. Iranian citizenship can also exist without an Iranian passport or Iranian birth documents, and can also affect people who have had no contact with Iran themselves. Characteristics of Iranian nationality suspected by Iranian authorities include, for example, name or place of birth. Dual nationals who also have Iranian citizenship are particularly exposed to interrogations and/or arrests without justifiable reasons, including when entering Iran. There are more and more cases of imposing exit bans, including for people who have not completed military service) as well as checking cell phones, cameras and PCs. Criminal prosecution of political activities in Germany (e.g. participation in demonstrations critical of the regime in Germany) and even imprisonment and conviction in Iran cannot be ruled out. In 2023, people of Iranian origin living in Western countries who had taken part in demonstrations critical of the regime were specifically arrested while staying in Iran, prosecuted and forced to confess through torture in order to deter protesters. If you have any doubts about your existing Iranian nationality (in addition to German), please check with the Iranian authorities or the relevant Iranian diplomatic mission before you start your journey to see whether you actually have Iranian nationality. According to Iranian law, it is a criminal offense for a man and a woman to live together in a marriage-like union without marriage. Dual nationals whose marriage is not recognized in Iran may have to expect criminal consequences when entering the country. In this case, Iranian birth certificates and passports must be applied for in Iran for children entering the country before they can leave Iran. This can be associated with considerable difficulties and time delays. Carry your valid Iranian passport with you when entering and leaving Iran. Please note that consular support from the German Embassy in Tehran is significantly limited or even impossible. In particular, the German Embassy Tehran cannot protect you from possible criminal prosecution. If the validity of your Iranian passport has expired or your passport has been revoked by the Iranian authorities, you will only be able to leave the country after the Iranian authorities have issued a new Iranian passport or returned your passport. A German passport is not sufficient to leave Iran if you also have Iranian citizenship; You also need an Iranian passport. To enter Germany, carry a valid German passport with you. If necessary, a German passport that has expired up to one year or a German identity card also entitles you to enter Germany. If you want to travel back to Germany without a valid German passport, you should check with your airline before starting your journey whether your transport is also possible with an ID card or an expired passport. Military service of German-Iranian dual nationals At the beginning of the Iranian calendar year (“Nowruz”, March 21st), in which a man turns 18, he becomes compulsory in military service in Iran and must perform active military service for 24 months. After reaching the age of 50, a man is exempt from military service; However, he may have to do military service until he is 60 years old. There is an obligation to register for military service (all Iranians living abroad must report to the Iranian diplomatic mission responsible for them without being asked). Under certain conditions, Iranians living abroad can be granted entry to Iran once a year without having to do military service. Details can be obtained from the responsible Iranian diplomatic mission abroad. Please note that as a male dual national, you can be banned from leaving the country until you have completed your military service in Iran (or received an exemption). Information for German wives of Iranian citizens According to the knowledge of the German Embassy in Tehran, the German wife automatically acquires Iranian citizenship through a marriage with an Iranian that is valid under Iranian law. Only those can provide legally binding information regarding the acquisition of Iranian citizenshiprelevant Iranian authorities. German citizenship is not lost if you acquire citizenship automatically. In individual cases it may happen that the Iranian authorities withhold the German passport of the person concerned when entering the country or when issuing the so-called Shenasnameh (civil status document) for the German wife. In this case, you should contact the German Embassy in Tehran immediately. Since under Iranian law the husband has the right of residence for both his wife and their children, the Iranian husband can refuse to allow his wife and their children to leave the country. Wife and children need their husband's consent to leave the country again. The risk of a possible ban on leaving the country and all its consequences must be carefully considered, especially for children traveling with you. The Iranian husband can impose a ban on leaving the country as long as the marriage continues under Iranian law. This is also possible after a divorce that took place outside Iran, as long as the foreign divorce has not been officially registered by the Iranian authorities and recorded in the shenasnamehs (civil status documents) of the parties involved. In this case, the woman cannot leave the country without the consent of her former husband until the divorce is registered and registered in an Iranian court case. If necessary, deal with this problem before entering the country. If your passport is confiscated upon entry, please contact the German embassy in Tehran immediately. If necessary, apply for the divorce to be registered at an Iranian diplomatic mission abroad in good time before a trip in order to avoid a delay in the return journey to Germany."", 'Import regulations': 'Cash with a value of up to EUR 10,000 may be imported without further declaration and with a value of up to EUR 5,000 may be exported. Larger amounts must be declared. Do not introduce alcohol, pork and publications that could violate the very strict Iranian moral code. You may carry a carpet up to six m² in size and no more than 30 years old. The export of antiques (items older than 30 years) is only permitted with a permit from the Cultural Heritage Organization. To do this, please visit the Cultural Heritage Organization of the Province of Tehran by making an appointment in advance, presenting a flight ticket as proof of departure (Tel. +98 21 667020614, extension 212, Imam Khomeini Str. 30 Tir Str., Iran Bastan Museum). Entry by car It is unclear whether it is still possible to enter Iran with your own vehicle, see current news.

When entering from a yellow fever area or staying in transit for more than 12 hours in a yellow fever area, all persons aged nine months or older must provide proof of a yellow fever vaccination. Iran itself is not an area infected with yellow fever. Make sure that you and your children's standard vaccinations are up to date according to the Robert Koch Institute's vaccination calendar. Ensure full vaccination protection against poliomyelitis (polio), see Poliomyelitis. Vaccinations against hepatitis A are recommended as travel vaccinations, and for long-term stays or special exposure also against dengue fever, hepatitis B, typhoid and rabies. Please note the application instructions and help for the indication in the travel vaccination recommendations. The DTG offers current, detailed travel vaccination recommendations for professionals."", 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. From March to November there is a minimal risk of malaria in rural areas of the Hormozgan province, in the south of the provinces of Sistan and Baluchestan and Kerman (tropical part). The tourist regions of the country are considered malaria-free, see Standing Committee on Travel Medicine (StAR) of the DTG. Under normal conditions (travel duration of up to approx. 4 weeks, hotel accommodation with air conditioning, informed and cautious traveler), medical malaria prophylaxis is not recommended. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed parts of your body in the evenings and at night. If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions, although this is only low in Iran (prevalence less than 0.1%). Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is still relatively widespread in Iran. Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases can be prevented through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'rabies': 'Rabies is a fatal infectious disease caused by viruses that are transmitted in the saliva of infected animals or people. There is a high risk of bite injuries from stray dogs and monkeys nationwide, see rabies. Avoid contact with animals. Get advice about a rabies vaccination and get vaccinated. The vaccination series should definitely be completed before you travel. Even if you have already been vaccinated, consult a doctor immediately after contact with a potentially infected animal or person (bite, licking of injured skin areas or droplets of saliva on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes).', 'Leishmaniasis': 'Cutaneous leishmaniasis is particularly common in rural areas. This is a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies with skin changes that usually only appear weeks to months after the bite and persist for a long time. In the case of persistent, unclear attacks of fever and enlargement of the spleen, the dangerous, generalized (so-called “visceral”) form can also be present. Protect yourself adequately from sand flies as part of exposure prophylaxis. If you have non-healing skin ulcers or persistent bouts of fever, please go to a clinic with experience in tropical medicine.', 'Geographically related diseases': 'Iran is currently a rather rare destination for trekking tourists who climb to high altitudes. There is often not enough time for gradual height adjustment. Various forms of acute altitude sickness are possible, see altitude sickness. Before traveling to high altitudes (above 2,300 m), seek individual advice from a doctor experienced in high-altitude medicine before finalizing your travel plans. Travel health insurance that covers the risk of mountains (e.g. helicopter evacuation) is strongly recommended. Intense sunlight, glare from snow and ice, strong winds, extreme cold and impassable or unknown terrain pose additional risks for travelers at high altitudes. Earthquakes or persistent rainfall can cause avalanches, mudslides and entire mountain slopes to slide in vulnerable areas. There are no civil air rescue companies in Iran for helicopter rescue from mountain emergencies, only the option of evacuation by the military, which is very bureaucratic and time-consuming. Depending on the location of the accident, the alarm can often only be triggered with a very long delay; the use of satellite phones is strictly forbidden in Iran. Despite great time pressure due to the need to obtain approvals from various government agencies, it can sometimes take several days, especially on weekends, until a search party or a helicopter is ready for action. Due to the weather, the aircraft are not always ready for use and can usually only take off early in the morning within a very narrow time window. In any case, the assumption of costs for a rescue must be clarified before the start of the rescue operation and is usually initially borne by the injured person.', 'Air pollution': 'Traffic congestion is high in Tehran. Due to the additional exhaust gases from industry, there is increased smog pollution in the metropolis surrounded by mountains, especially in the winter months. Breathing problems and headaches are not uncommon. Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual.', 'Medical care': 'The specialized medical care, especially in emergencies or accidents, in many parts of the country is not at the same level as the capital in terms of medical, hygiene, technology and organization and is not comparable to European standards. Language barriers can make communication difficult, especially in rural areas. A reliably functioning rescue service does not exist everywhere, even in cities. In Tehran, medical care in all specialist disciplines is usually available at a fairly high level. Even in the case of serious illnesses, medical evacuation abroad, e.g. to Dubai, or immediate repatriation rarely needs to be considered. Adequate health insurance coverage, including travel repatriation insurance, is still urgently necessary. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors via DTG, for example. In addition to the general exclusion of liability, please note: No guarantee can be given for the accuracy and completeness of the medical information or liability for any damage that may occur. All information depends on the individual travel conditions and does not replace medical consultation or in-depth medical advice.

If visas from Arab states or Iran are present in the passport, however, a security questioning by Israeli security forces must be expected upon entry (exception: Jordan and Egypt). This also applies to stamps/visas from Malaysia, Indonesia or Sudan. Furthermore, German citizens with even suspected Arab or Iranian descent or Islamic religious affiliation must expect an intensive security questioning and possible refusal of entry. If entry is refused, it is common practice to be taken to a deportation center until the return flight. The Israeli parliament passed a law that would generally bar non-Israeli citizens from entering Israel if they have publicly and knowingly called for a boycott of Israel or committed themselves to taking part in such a boycott. The same applies if you belong to an organization or work at an institution that has called for such a boycott. This also includes the boycott of settlements in the West Bank or East Jerusalem. This regulation does not affect holders of a permanent residence permit for Israel. Please note that the relevant passport authority can issue a second passport. German citizens of Palestinian origin also have to expect a security interview and possibly longer waiting times, especially when entering the country from Egypt and Jordan. A security questioning lasting several hours, which can lead to refusal of entry immediately at the border crossing, is possible at any time without giving reasons. The German embassy in Tel Aviv has no way of providing support in these cases. When leaving Israel via Ben Gurion Airport, time-consuming security checks of luggage and interviews with travelers take place. It is advisable to arrive at the airport early. If electrical devices, especially laptops, are retained for examination by the Israeli security authorities, they are usually sent to the traveler's location after one to three days. Each airline sets its own terms and conditions of carriage. Check-in and passenger and baggage checks for flights to Israel are handled differently by the airlines, and there may be additional security checks and waiting times that require you to arrive at the airport early.

Earthquakes Italy is located in a very seismically active zone, which is why earthquakes, some of them severe, occur more frequently. Volcanoes Several volcanoes in Italy are constantly active. The Phlegraean fields in Campania are classified as supervolcanoes and repeatedly show changes that have led to evacuation measures in the past. Vesuvius in the immediate vicinity of Naples last erupted in 1944 and is under observation. Etna on Sicily is the most active volcano in Europe and, like the Stromboli volcano on the island of the same name, has recently shown minor eruptions, some of which have caused disruptions in air traffic.

Floods, danger of avalanches, storms The climate is Central European in the north and Mediterranean in the center and south. All year round, especially in the summer months, northern Italy experiences floods and landslides due to heavy rainfall and storms, which can lead to traffic disruptions. During the winter months there is often a risk of avalanches and landslides in the mountains of northern Italy. When there is a thaw, there is a risk of flooding, especially in northern Italy. Venice is regularly affected by flooding during high water (acqua alta), making some squares and alleys impassable. Flooding can also occur in Rome after heavy rain. In the Mediterranean, isolated severe autumn storms and even so-called ""Medicanes"" can occur, especially from August to November. As a result, flooding and landslides as well as significant traffic disruptions are possible.

If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. In Cambodia, the risk of malaria exists all year round, but is more severe during the rainy seasons. Increasing artemisinin resistance is reported. A medium risk of malaria exists in most parts of the country, highest in the rainforest in the border areas with Thailand and Laos, lower in a broad belt through the middle of the country from SE to NW along the Mekong to north of the Tonle Sap. A low risk within this belt around Phnom Penh and immediately around the Tonle Sap. Phnom Penh and Angkor Wat are considered malaria-free. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market.

This includes Benoue and Bouba Ndjidda National Parks, which are cautioned against visiting. A partial travel warning remains in effect in the Nigerian states of Borno and Adamawa across the border due to the poor security situation. A partial travel warning also applies to the border area on the Chad side. Violent clashes between security forces and separatist groups continue in the two Anglophone regions North-West and South-West, resulting in deaths and injuries. There is an increased risk of explosive devices, roadblock attacks and kidnappings on all roads within these two regions. The border area with the Central African Republic is considered unsafe due to cross-border attacks by armed rebel groups there. There is also a risk of becoming a victim of kidnapping or robbery. There is a travel warning for the Central African Republic. There are ongoing security problems in the Bakassi Peninsula and surrounding areas near the border with Nigeria. Throughout the Gulf of Guinea there are attacks on coastal towns, fishing boats, oil tankers and oil platforms with the taking of hostages. The risk of kidnapping also exists in all remote areas of Cameroon. Avoid the areas mentioned in the travel warning and especially leave the “Extrême Nord” region if you are staying there.

Experience shows that before holidays, especially in the run-up to Christmas, the number of thefts and robberies increases significantly, especially in metropolitan areas. Bag snatching is common. Due to the perpetrators' regular willingness to use violence, we strongly advise against resisting. After dark the dangers are even higher. In Duala there is an increasing number of criminal acts (robbery, bodily harm) by large groups of children and young people, mostly armed with machetes, so-called “microbes”. The Cameroonian security forces have not yet been able to stop this. There is currently a ban on motorcycles and motorcycle taxis between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. in Duala, and the sale of alcohol is partially restricted. There is a risk of this crime phenomenon spreading to other urban areas in the country. Petty crimes such as thefts occur particularly on trains, buses and taxis. In the past, violent robberies have occurred in taxis that were not pre-booked but stopped on the street. Shared taxis in particular are at risk of armed robberies, in which victims can sustain injuries. Around Bertua on the road connecting Cameroon and the Central African Republic, the number of criminal attacks using armed force has increased significantly, particularly against motorcycle taxi drivers and passengers, and there have been several deaths. Night driving bans on motorcycles have been imposed in Bertua and Mandjou until further notice. Fake security officers and other fraud attempts, including via the Internet, are widespread in Cameroon. In several cases, tourists traveling alone or in pairs with luggage have been robbed during the day on busy stretches of beaches in popular seaside resorts and in the Melong region. Be particularly attentive in public places, when visiting international facilities and at prominent tourist attractions. Be particularly vigilant and look after your valuables in large crowds such as train stations, public transport and beaches. Avoid wearing conspicuous valuables or jewelry, especially in larger cities and holiday resorts frequented by foreign tourists. Only take the cash you need for the day and divide it into different bags along the way. After dark, avoid walking and unfamiliar neighborhoods and stay on well-lit streets. If you are attacked, do not resist and remain calm. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Do not hail taxis on the street, but rather order them through your hotel, for example. Consider hiring a trustworthy driver for the entire duration of your stay. Always keep doors and windows locked and locked, especially at night. Make sure it is authentic with police and gendarmerie security officers using your ID card and, if necessary, contact the German embassy. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances.

Special caution is currently advised when traveling to areas in the North Rift Region (Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu), see Safety - Crime.', 'terrorism': ""There is an increased risk of terrorist attacks in Kenya. The Somali terrorist organization Al-Shabaab has threatened retaliation in response to the Kenyan Armed Forces' participation in the ATMIS (formerly AMISOM) mission in Somalia and called for solidarity actions with Hamas. Several attacks and a number of foiled attacks have demonstrated the terrorists' determination. In 2019, there was an attack on the DusitD2 hotel and office complex; In 2020, a suicide attack on a Kenyan military camp in Lamu province. Government buildings, hotels, bars and restaurants, shopping centers, church facilities, public transport such as buses, minibuses, ferries, airports and other busy facilities are among the places with increased risk. Visits to the border area with Somalia in northeastern Kenya, including Lamu Province, are strongly discouraged due to terrorist activities. Lamu Island and Manda Island have not yet been the target of any attacks. However, there is an increased emergence of active terrorist cells that are penetrating close to the archipelago. There is an increased risk of kidnapping when staying and traveling to remote places or side routes in the coastal region, with the exception of tourist facilities. Be particularly careful in busy places and on special occasions. If possible, avoid large gatherings of people. Be sure to avoid travel closer than approximately 100 km to the Somali border, including Kiwayu and the coastal areas north of Pate Island, as well as non-essential travel to Lamu Island and Manda Island. Be particularly careful when making essential visits to the Lamu Archipelago and only travel by air. For unavoidable road trips to the northern and northeastern parts of Kenya, the coastal region north of Malindi, the Northeast Province and the Northern Coastal Province - especially Lamu - be sure to seek protection in a guarded convoy. Also note the global safety notice."", 'Domestic political situation': 'Demonstrations for political or social reasons occur where violent clashes cannot be ruled out. Demonstrations can take place in Kenya at any time, even without a specific call. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. In Nairobi, completely avoid the Central Business District (CBD), the State House and the Kibera and Mathare districts during demonstration times. Likewise the streets Moi Avenue, Kenyatta Avenue, Haile Selassie Avenue and Harambee Avenue. Be sure to follow the instructions of local security forces. Find out about local media. In Laikipia and neighboring counties, conflicts over grazing and land rights are increasing. This leads to violent clashes and attacks on farms and lodges. There is a risk of tribal clashes in the northern and northeastern parts of Kenya.', 'crime': ""Particular caution is advised when traveling to the North Rift Region (Turkana, West Pokot, Elgeyo Marakwet, Baringo, Laikipia and Samburu). The Kenyan government has declared parts of the North Rift region to be particularly vulnerable. The background is increased attacks by gangs in this area, fueled by disputes over land and resources. Avoid large gatherings of people and follow local media. Only go to secure accommodation and places to stay. Follow the instructions of local security forces. The risk of becoming a victim of armed attacks exists in all parts of the country. Espionage cannot be ruled out, which then leads to so-called flash kidnappings, in which Western foreigners are held for several hours in order to withdraw large amounts of money using their bank cards. Certain parts of Nairobi such as Eastleigh, Pangani and slum areas are particularly dangerous. There have also been several recent cases of fraud in Nairobi, in which the fraudsters approached travelers disguised as police officers. It is therefore advisable to always ask for the identity card of the alleged police officer and not to follow him without an understandable reason. In Nairobi and Mombasa there is an increased risk of robberies, including car jacking, targeting both pedestrians and drivers. Violent attacks on groups of visitors have also occurred in the past during organized “slum tours”. Walking on beaches after dark and outside hotel complexes poses an increased risk of being mugged. There is an increased risk of armed robbery and kidnapping in the northern and northeastern parts of Kenya, in the coastal region north of Malindi and on the roads to the Northeast Province and the Northern Coastal Province. Recently, there have been attacks, sometimes with serious bodily harm, following sexual encounters on dating platforms. Sporadic criminal activities are also reported in the Kenya-Tanzania border area in the Maasai Mara, Lake Natron, Namanga, Amboseli Park and Samburu\xa0regions. There are occasional attacks on privately rented bungalows and holiday homes belonging to individual tourists, especially on the coast. Armed robberies have also occasionally occurred when visiting bars, restaurants and nightclubs, particularly on the coast. Avoid certain areas of Nairobi such as Eastleigh, Pangani and slum areas in general, as well as the Dadaab and Kakuma refugee camps. Avoid downtown Nairobi and Mombasa at night. Visit the old town of Mombasa, even during the day, only with people who know the area. If in doubt, you should also take a taxi for shorter distances. Be particularly attentive in large crowds, poorer neighborhoods and at bus stations and look after your valuables. Before individual excursions, obtain information about assessing the situation and assessing risks from travel and hotel management. As an individual tourist in national parks, only stay in lodges or on guarded campsites and pay attention to appropriate security precautions. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. If you prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables, do not wear them visibly. Be particularly careful when using debit and credit cards and making withdrawals from ATMs. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances, as well as appointments via dating platforms. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police. Since the end of September 2022, there have been at least three robberies against German citizens in which a firearm was threatened or a firearm was used as a cutting weapon. Therefore, avoid remote areas. Only use the phone in public if absolutely necessary, otherwise keep your cell phone safe. If you are carrying a bag, carry it on the side facing away from the street. Only carry as much cash with you as is absolutely necessary. Carry valuables spread out across your body. Pay particular attention to “boda bodas” (motorcycle taxis). Under no circumstances should you resist a robbery.

Against this background, the already tense security situation has become even worse. Recently, against the background of the poor security situation, especially in the eastern provinces, there have been increasing protests, some of them violent, against the UN mission MONUSCO and against the peacekeeping force (Regional Force) of the East African Community (EAC), which has been stationed in the area since November 2022. Further riots, including against non-governmental organizations and international personnel, cannot be ruled out. The “Virunga” and “Kahuzi-Biega” national parks are under immediate threat from armed groups. In 2020, several park rangers and civilians were killed in an ambush by the rebel group FDLR not far from the headquarters of the Virunga Park Administration in Rugari, on the road between Goma and Rutshuru. In 2021, three people, including the Italian ambassador, died in an armed attack on a WFP (World Food Program) convoy north of Goma.

For tours in the country, the main options are buses (Viazul), organized bus tours and rental cars, although bus trips are less problematic in terms of traffic safety. There may be shortages of everyday items and medications. Due to gasoline shortages, gas stations may be closed or there may be very long waiting times. There are usually separate gas stations for rental cars. Particularly in the summer months, there are often power outages outside of the tourist centers in Cuba, sometimes lasting several hours, usually announced in advance, due to fuel shortages, which can also lead to disruptions in water supplies and communication.

There is a ban on driving while driving. Furthermore, the consumption of alcohol in the passenger compartment of a car, including for passengers, is prohibited. In addition, no alcohol may be carried in the passenger compartment of the car if consumption is obvious. In the event of accidents involving personal injuries involving foreign travelers, there may be a ban on leaving the country lasting several weeks and possibly even pre-trial detention.

The import of foreign currency is possible without restriction, but must be declared if the value exceeds USD 5,000. If exporting more than 5,000 USD, approval must be obtained in advance from the Cuban Central Bank. The import and export of local currency is prohibited.

Of the 270 million explosive devices dropped, it is estimated that 80 million did not explode (unexploded ordnances, UXO). These contaminate large areas of the country. Particularly in the eastern parts of the country, there are still countless unexploded explosive devices lying away from the marked paths. Attapeu Province Tensions have arisen in the border region between the districts of Phouvong and Sanamxay in connection with border negotiations between Laos and Cambodia. Military units were stationed on both sides. The Laotian military has imposed a restrictive access policy for the area of \u200b\u200bthe border strip, which is 140 kilometers long.

There is a risk of serious health damage if you consume food and drinks laced with drugs. Robberies, handbag thefts and moped thefts can occur in the cities of Vientiane, Luang Prabang and Vang Vieng, which are heavily frequented by tourists. Particular caution is required in “bag-snatching” incidents, in which thieves approach their victims from behind while riding a moped and snatch their handbags and backpacks. Motorbike or moped rental companies regularly require a passport as security and, even if the two-wheeler is slightly damaged or stolen, they often only return it after paying an arbitrarily set amount. Many rental agreements do not provide for compensation for damages in the event of theft; in these cases, rental companies usually require at least payment of the replacement value. In individual cases, landlords and thieves collude to the detriment of the tenant, so-called scooter scams. The Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone in Ton Pheung District of Bokeo Province, which borders Thailand and Myanmar, is experiencing significant criminal activity in the areas of drug trafficking, human trafficking and labor fraud. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports, train stations, on buses and pay attention to your valuables. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe. In the event of an attack, do not resist. Avoid any contact with drugs. Please exercise extreme caution when staying in Bokeo Province. Follow the instructions of local security forces. If possible, avoid leaving your passport with motorcycle or moped rental companies and carefully check the insurance conditions in the event of loss; if necessary, avoid renting it.

During the rainy season from May to November, monsoon-like rains can cause widespread flooding and landslides, particularly along the Mekong River and in mountainous regions. Laos is located in a seismically active zone, so earthquakes can occur. During the rainy season, follow forecasts of elevated water levels and flooding from e.g. the Mekong River Commission and the National Disaster Management Office (NDMO). Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Familiarize yourself with what to do in the event of an earthquake. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'Traffic routes may be affected due to measures related to the containment of COVID-19, see current information. The safety standard of air transport has improved significantly with the use of new aircraft by the two national airlines for the most important domestic routes. Flight connections to the remote provinces remain problematic because of the often bad weather and the lack of technical equipment at the airports there. These routes should be avoided, especially in the rainy season (from May to October). Flights can be canceled at short notice if there are not enough passengers flying. Speed \u200b\u200bboats are often involved in accidents, occasionally fatal. Normal boats (so-called slow boats) also operate on almost all routes. In many provinces, the road and bridge network can be severely affected by heavy rainfall. Many roads are then in poor condition. Particularly in the rainy season, it often happens that entire sections of road, especially in rural areas, are flooded or washed away and are hardly or no longer passable. In the dark, dangers are incalculable. Road traffic also poses particular risks due to the behavior of road users and the condition of many vehicles (not least intercity buses). Drunk drivers contribute to the high traffic risk, especially in the evenings and on public holidays. The accident rate (including fatalities) is high. Users of motorized two-wheelers must wear a protective helmet. If a foreigner is involved in an accident, his passport is usually confiscated and payment of the (entire) damage and, if necessary, compensation is demanded, regardless of who is at fault. It can be difficult or impossible, even in obviously justified cases, to claim compensation from tour operators in the country. Serious injuries or illnesses can only receive inadequate care outside of the few urban centers. If possible, avoid using speedboats. Only go on hikes and visits to national parks with someone who knows the area.

Taking items with you (transporting items for third parties without knowing the contents) can also have disastrous consequences. Laotian criminal law already provides for several years' imprisonment for the possession of even small amounts of drugs. The criminal proceedings do not correspond to our constitutional ideas (years of pre-trial detention, expensive and inadequate legal representation, harsh prison conditions). The Lao authorities have further intensified law enforcement in the area of \u200b\u200bdrug-related crime. Simply smoking a joint can lead to arrest and usually the payment of a significant fine (around EUR 500). Increasingly, drug acquisition, consumption and now even being in the immediate vicinity of a user is being used as a kind of complicity by interested parties to blackmail those affected. Serious drug offenses can result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty (possession or trafficking of more than 500 grams of heroin, three kilograms of amphetamines and/or ten kilograms of chemicals for drug production). Death sentences have already been imposed, although not carried out. The increasing number of deaths of foreign drug users indicates that the quality of drugs appears to be misjudged. Sexual contact outside of marriage is traditionally not permitted in Laos. This is particularly true for intimate relationships between foreigners and Laotians. In the past, suspected violations have been punished in individual cases with more than symbolic fines or prison sentences (the official penalty is 500 to 5,000 USD). Cases of extortion and night raids on hotels and private accommodation are not uncommon. Sexual intercourse with anyone under the age of 18 is punishable under Lao law. The sexual abuse of minors by German citizens is prosecuted in Germany even if the crime was committed in Laos. Taking photos of military installations is prohibited. When photographing people and religious institutions or monks - as everywhere - appropriate restraint should be exercised. It is forbidden to stay on the lower Mekong waterfront in Vientiane after 10 p.m. The river is the immediate border area here. Tourists who stay there after 10 p.m. risk being interrogated and arrested by border police. Gambling is prohibited and is punishable by a fine. There have been cases of passengers being arrested on the train for playing cards. It didn't matter that the card game wasn't a game of chance. Hooliganism is prohibited and punishable by a fine. This refers to the violation of the rules and discipline of social life while using violence, threats, offensive language or other activities that contradict social order.

As part of your travel preparation, check your and your children's vaccination protection against measles and have it supplemented if necessary."", 'Vaccination protection': ""Vaccination regulations may currently differ due to measures to contain COVID-19, see current information. No compulsory vaccinations are required for direct entry from Germany. If you are entering from a yellow fever area, you must provide proof of a yellow fever vaccination. Proof of vaccination may also be required when traveling via Addis Ababa (Ethiopia) or Nairobi (Kenya). The international vaccination certificate for yellow fever is now valid for life. In practice, there are no checks of yellow fever vaccination status when entering the country by land across the borders with Zambia, Tanzania or Mozambique. When traveling through several African countries, it is advisable to carry a vaccination certificate with proof of a valid yellow fever vaccination. When leaving Malawi, a polio vaccination is recommended by the WHO for people who have been in the country for longer than four weeks, see Poliomyelitis. Ensure full vaccination protection against poliomyelitis (polio), see Poliomyelitis. Make sure that you and your children's standard vaccinations are up to date according to the Robert Koch Institute's vaccination calendar. If you are in the country for less than four weeks, a conventional vaccination against poliomyelitis is sufficient. Check your vaccination status and have a booster vaccination if the last vaccination was more than ten years ago. Vaccinations against hepatitis A are recommended as travel vaccinations, and for long-term stays or special exposure also against hepatitis B, typhoid, rabies and meningococcal disease (ACWY).

If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a high risk of malaria all year round, particularly near Lake Malawi and in the lower southern parts of the country. There is only a low risk in the north and at altitudes above 2000 meters. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.

However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Poliomyelitis (child paralysis)': 'Malawi is one of the few countries in the world where poliovirus infections are still being reported. Transmission occurs through fecally contaminated drinking water or food. If you are traveling for less than four weeks, make sure you are fully vaccinated against poliomyelitis. Booster vaccinations are necessary every ten years. If you are traveling and staying in the country for longer periods of more than four weeks, you should also be vaccinated against poliomyelitis with one dose four weeks to 12 months before you leave the country again.

The zone includes the towns of Sandakan, Lahad Datu, Tawau, Kunak and Semporna as well as offshore islands including Sipadan Island. There have been kidnappings and attempted kidnappings in the past. An acute threat to the tourist destinations there and thus the risk of attacks and kidnappings remains significant and also affects the area around the ESS ZONE, especially after dark near the coast and on the islands. For all types of watercraft, there is a nighttime navigation ban from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. in the coastal waters adjacent to the ESS ZONE up to three nautical miles from the coast. There are cases of\xa0piracy in shipping in the waters around Malaysia, particularly in the Strait of Malacca. Traveling from Malaysia to Thailand by land is strongly discouraged.

Valuables lying visibly in cars encourage burglaries. Particular caution is also required when staying overnight in hostels or low-budget hotels, especially in the heavily frequented districts of Kuala Lumpur, Bukit Bintang and Chinatown. Within and in the immediate vicinity of these, tourists have repeatedly become victims of robbery and theft. Violent crime against foreigners is otherwise not widespread. Tricks, especially those involving gambling, are commonplace. Solo travelers are particularly affected, as they are targeted in tourist locations and lured into private apartments under a pretext. In bars it can happen that tourists have drugs and so-called knockout drops mixed into their drinks. Internet fraud is often committed from Malaysia. It is not uncommon for people to initially initiate personal fictitious relationships on the Internet in order to then borrow money that is never paid back. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary.

When traveling overland by bus, pay particular attention to the luggage that is stowed in the overhead compartment. There is left-hand traffic. Tolls are largely required on the well-developed motorway network. Country roads are usually narrow, poorly lit and have potholes. Be particularly careful when using a bicycle, moped or motorbike, especially if you are inexperienced. Driving on the left and an unfamiliar driving style in Malaysia can lead to dangerous misjudgments and accidents. When visiting nature parks, it is advisable to be accompanied by certified guides who are familiar with the area, as the signage on jungle paths is often inadequate.

Three locally acquired infections with Plasmodium falciparum (Malaria tropica) were last reported from Casablanca in 2010. Before these cases occurred, Morocco was considered malaria-free according to the WHO and has been so since then. There is currently no relevant risk for travelers, so exposure prophylaxis (see below) is sufficient. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis.

A medium risk exists all year round in the southern parts of the country near the Senegal River as well as in Adrar and Inchiri. The provinces of Dakhlet-Nouadhibou and Tiris-Zemour in the north of the country are considered to be completely malaria-free. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also make sense in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms, especially with casual acquaintances.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Crimean-Congo fever': 'Mauritania is one of the countries where Crimean-Congo fever can occur sporadically. Since 2003, around 40 illnesses have been reported, mainly in Nouakchott, few of which were fatal. The virus is transmitted via ticks from farm animals such as sheep, goats, cattle and camels, as well as via blood from infected animals and people. Good protection against ticks and distance from animals is recommended.', 'Rift-Valley-Fever': 'The disease is endemic in Mauritania, in the border area with Mali; In 2011 it was transported to the oases of the north by infected camels. Since 2012, repeated outbreaks with deaths, including among humans, have been reported in Mauritania. Rift Valley Fever is a viral zoonosis (disease in animals) that has regularly affected sheep, goats, camels, cows, donkeys and, in individual cases, humans since the 1980s. Transmission to humans occurs through contact with slaughter and dairy products from infected animals, through virus-containing aerosols and through mosquito bites, especially from daytime active mosquitoes. Human-to-human transmission has not yet been documented. The disease is often mild. In less than 4% of cases, serious illness or even fatal hemorrhagic fever can occur. Please note the information in Rift Valley Fever.', 'Schistosomiasis (Bilharziose)': 'Schistosomiasis is transmitted when bathing, wading or other leisure activities in or near fresh water (through the penetration of the worm larvae through the intact skin, see also Schistosomiasis).

Medical care in Nouakchott is limited. French-speaking specialists in almost all disciplines are available. German-speaking doctors are not known. Outside Nouakchott there is only extremely rudimentary medical care. Planned operations should only be carried out in Europe. In an emergency, some private clinics and some public hospitals in Nouakchott may be considered. The pharmacies in Nouakchott have a limited range of essential standard medicines, often of French origin. Counterfeit medications with unsafe contents occur. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first-aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures on the go, see first-aid kit. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG.

Despite the long lead up to election day, political competition is already shaping Mexican domestic politics, which is in largely peaceful pre-election campaign mode. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces.', 'crime': ""Violence in Mexico is stagnating at a high level across the board. Particularly in areas controlled by organized crime (see Security section above), opponents are often killed in clashes between rival gangs and no consideration is given to bystanders. During exchanges of fire between criminal groups or with security forces, even uninvolved tourists can get caught in the crossfire, which can result in death. In this respect, even public and frequently visited places do not always offer safety. Violent crimes and property crimes are commonplace. The most common crimes are thefts, robberies and express kidnappings. Police or uniformed security personnel, or criminals posing as such, may be involved in crimes. Violence against women is high, including murders, sexual assaults and attempted kidnappings, including in tourist regions. Most crimes go unsolved. Firearms are common; their use is often unrestrained. This also applies to attacks in stationary traffic and on public buses. Here even verbal retorts are often answered brutally. The risk of being attacked is particularly high when driving overland at night and away from toll motorways, as well as at busy rest areas and gas stations. Under pretexts such as a defect or a request for roadside assistance, travelers are made to stop and then attacked. The acquisition and consumption of drugs are prosecuted by the security authorities. Serious health damage and deaths have repeatedly occurred due to the consumption of contaminated narcotics. The approval of small quantities of marijuana is subject to restrictive conditions; its purchase and consumption remains de facto forbidden to foreign travelers. Traveling and visiting in groups usually offers more security than unaccompanied visits, as do protected hotel complexes compared to going out in city centers after dark. Organized and guided tours usually take existing safety risks into account. When hiking in nature reserves, e.g. when climbing volcanoes, there is a risk of robbery. There are not enough guarded campsites for mobile homes or camping cars. ATMs can be tampered with to copy data, and credit card abuse continues to be a problem. Only carry out essential trips to the regions and cities for which travel is strongly discouraged with a viable security concept. If you find yourself in an emergency, call 911. Please also note the phone number for the embassy's on-call service in Mexico City. Use toll highways (Cuota) wherever possible. Limit stops to the minimum necessary and only stop at busy rest areas and gas stations. Plan your travels in Mexico so that you reach your destination before dark. If you are traveling by car or RV and notice that you are being followed or watched, drive to the nearest police station or other safe location. In the event of an attack or car jacking, do not resist under any circumstances, not even verbally. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports, train stations, on the subway, on the bus and pay attention to your valuables. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables or flashy jewelry. Avoid staying in deserted areas and districts, but also on deserted beaches. Women should not travel alone, especially at night and in lonely areas. Report sexual assaults (including attempted ones) immediately to the nearest “Ministerio Público” (public prosecutor’s office) office. Occasionally, knockout drops or other narcotics are used specifically to prepare for a rape or robbery. Therefore, do not accept drinks or food from strangers. Do not leave your drinks and food unattended in restaurants. Only drive with the windows closed and the doors locked, only park vehicles in guarded parking spaces and do not leave any valuables behind. Break-ins in rental cars are regularly reported. If you have luggage in your rental car, do not leave it unattended. ID cards/documents should also be taken with you when leaving the car for a short time. Be sure to avoid hitchhiking or picking up hitchhikers. Do not stay overnight with strangers or inunknown areas away from tourist areas. Be careful at ATMs, preferably use machines during the day and inside secured buildings (malls) and be aware of possible tampering. Don't let your credit card out of your sight when paying. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, contacts and requests for help from alleged acquaintances, especially in the case of alleged kidnappings of relatives. Keep calm, do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police (so-called “virtual kidnapping”). If you are threatened on the phone, hang up immediately. Be suspicious if you are offered apparently tempting investment opportunities in Mexico and, if in doubt, consult a lawyer and Mexican authorities, e.g. the Mexican Consumer Protection Authority (Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor, “PROFECO”). The German Embassy in Mexico has received reports that uniformed security forces, including police officers, are demanding heavy fines or threatening arrest. If the legal situation is unclear, remain critical and, if in doubt, contact the Mexican emergency number 911 (also in English) or the embassy's on-call service. Do not make any payments if you did not commit the alleged crime, if the fine demanded seems unreasonably high or if you cannot be given a receipt/protocol. Write down the personal details, service numbers and vehicle license plates of the security guards checking.""}","{'General information': 'Tropical storms and floods The climate is tropical on the coasts and high altitudes at higher altitudes such as Mexico City. Hurricane season in Mexico runs from June to November. During this time, tropical storms and intense rainfall are expected, particularly on the coasts, which can trigger widespread flooding and landslides. Earthquakes and volcanoes Mexico is located in a very seismically active zone, which is why earthquakes, some of them severe, occur regularly. The older neighborhoods of Mexico City (including Roma) located on the former lakebed are particularly at risk. The greater Mexico City area and the states on the Pacific coast that are particularly prone to earthquakes have so far only been partially affected. The Popocatépetl volcano is increasingly active. There is a 12 km exclusion zone around the crater. The Colima volcano is also still active and closed to visitors. Ocean currents Strong currents and high waves can put even good swimmers at risk. Fatal swimming accidents occur every year, especially on the Pacific coast. In the event of natural events, expect short-term restrictions, including in air traffic. Follow weather reports regularly and pay attention to storm warnings from the National Hurricane Center. In the event of a storm warning, please note the information on hurricanes abroad. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of Mexican authorities.

Particularly during the holiday season, demonstrators may block main roads and toll booths. Continuation of the journey is sometimes permitted for a fee. Vehicles parked in appropriately marked areas where parking is prohibited will be towed away or immobilized with a parking claw and can only be released again after paying a large amount of money. In Mexico City in particular, there is a high volume of traffic with significant traffic jams. Due to poor air quality, there may be driving bans in the greater Mexico City area and other states on individual days depending on the vehicle license plate, which are also enforced by imposing fines. Car rental companies can provide information about this. Taxis stopped on the street pose a significant risk of being kidnapped and/or robbed, especially after dark but also during the day. In Mexico there is no comprehensive insurance requirement for car owners. In many Mexican states, including Yucatán and Mexico City, the driver of a car must also have liability insurance. Violations can result in fines and the car being impounded. Avoid second and third class buses for safety reasons. Only undertake cross-country journeys during the day and stick to main routes. Do not dispute the requested travel fees or discuss their legality. Be particularly careful in town because of the many poorly marked speed barriers (topes). Only take official taxis from official taxi ranks (Sitios) or order them, for example, via a taxi app or via Uber, Didi or Cabify. To travel to the archaeological site in Teotihuacán, in the northeast of Mexico City, do not use regular buses, but tourist buses.

However, there is no entitlement and experience has shown that this is only possible in very limited exceptional cases. Report the loss of your passport and/or tourist card to the Mexican police immediately. Tourist Card FMM Travelers entering Mexico by land must apply for an electronic tourist card or obtain an entry permit from an office of the National Migration Institute (INM), even if they are not specifically requested to do so by Mexican officials. The tourist card can be paid online or in cash in MXN against a receipt or at a bank branch. The card is stamped when you cross the border and the validity period is entered. The copy of the tourist card that remains with the traveler must always be carried and presented when leaving Mexico. Tourists are not allowed to carry out any other activities. After entering the country, for example as a tourist, it is not possible to apply for a residence permit for another purpose (e.g. employment). Visa before entry If a longer stay or employment, voluntary service, humanitarian aid or human rights activity in Mexico is intended, the Mexican embassy in Berlin or the Mexican consulate general in Frankfurt (Main) should be contacted before starting the journey regarding the visa requirements. Working holidays are not permitted in Mexico without a visa. During an internship in a hotel or catering establishment, simply accepting tips is interpreted as income/employment and can lead to arrest and deportation without the appropriate authorization. The Mexican diplomatic missions abroad and the Instituto Nacional de Migración provide further, detailed information. Voluntary services should, if possible, be planned within the framework of established programs such as “kulturweit”, “weltwärts” or “IJFD”. We strongly advise against continuing your journey through Mexico without a valid tourist visa. There is a risk of being taken into detention pending deportation during a check and quickly deported to Germany. Obligatory ID When checking people, not only ID is required, but also the Mexican residence permit (entry stamp in the passport, entry ticket or tourist card FMM, or long-term residence permit FM 2/3). Foreigners should carry their Mexican residence permit, at least a copy, with them at all times. Otherwise, you run the risk of being detained by immigration authorities and possibly deported.', 'Minors': ""Minors traveling alone or only accompanied by a parent should carry a permit from the parent not traveling with them, copies of the parents' passports and the minor's birth certificate. Minors traveling alone residing in Mexico and Mexican citizens (including dual nationals) who are not accompanied by a parental authority holder require a notarized declaration of consent from the parental authority holder to leave Mexico. This does not apply to minors staying in Mexico with tourist status. The Mexican diplomatic missions abroad and the Instituto Nacional de Migración provide further, detailed information. Please also note the instructions for a declaration of consent for minors."", 'Import regulations': 'The import and export regulations for goods to/from Mexico are strict.

Violations can result in very high fines. Further information can be found on the websites of the Mexican Embassy and Mexican Customs. Find out if you need to declare anything to customs when you arrive. Amounts exceeding USD 10,000 must be declared when entering the country. The export of local currency is permitted up to a value of 10,000 USD, of foreign currency up to the amount declared upon entry. The export of gold (except gold jewelry), antiques, archaeological finds, cacti, corals and other protected animals is prohibited. When you leave the country, checks are carried out as part of the fight against drug trafficking.

Chikungunya fever does not always heal without consequences; long-lasting rheumatism-like symptoms rarely occur. There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a low risk of malaria year-round in the province of Chiapas, parts of the provinces of Campeche, Cancun, Chihuahua, Nayarit, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Sonora, Tabasco and the region around San Pedro Tapanatepec in the province of Oaxaca. The remaining parts of the country are considered malaria-free. The proportion of malaria tertiana (P. vivax) is 100%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Leishmaniasis': 'The cutaneous and mucocutaneous forms occur in many parts of the country. The single-celled parasites are also transmitted by mosquitoes. To avoid leishmaniasis, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Leptospirosis': 'Leptospirosis can occasionally be transmitted year-round through water contaminated with rodent excrement. This bacterial infection usually progresses like a mild flu-like infection, but in rare cases it can also lead to serious involvement of the liver and kidneys, see leptospirosis. If exposure is to be expected in individual cases, after carefully weighing the risks, consider drug prophylaxis with doxycycline by a travel or tropical medicine specialist.', 'Trypanosomiasis („Chagas disease“)': 'In Mexico, American trypanosomiasis (Chagas) can be transmitted through the excretions of predatory bugs that live in cracks in simple dwellings in rural areas. These can be ingested through the bite of infected bugs or, more rarely, through contaminated fruit or sugar cane juices. In the acute phase of the disease, flu-like symptoms and possibly swelling of the eyelid are the main symptoms. Up to years after the infection, serious organ changes in the heart and digestive tract can occur. Overall, the risk for travelers of contracting Chagas is very low. Use correctly installed bed nets to protect against bites.', 'Air pollution': 'High levels of air pollution occur particularly in Mexico City. Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual.', 'Medical care': 'Overall, health care, especially in rural areas of Mexico, is often not comparable to the technical and hygienic standards prevailing in Germany. If possible, planned interventions should therefore take place in Germany. The costs for medical treatment (in principle also in emergencies!) and for medication, especially in the private sector, usually have to be paid immediately on site in cash (credit card payment may also be possible).

The contact person for related questions and applications is the Embassy of the Republic of Namibia.', 'Entry via\xa0South Africa': 'When entering Namibia via South Africa, special entry requirements have applied since 2015. Any overstay on a visa will result in being declared an undesirable person and an entry ban. For entry and transit with minor children, it is necessary to carry an international birth certificate identifying the parents, as well as, if necessary, a declaration of consent from the parent not accompanying you or proof of sole custody. The responsible South African diplomatic mission provides detailed and binding information.', 'Minors': ""With reference to the entry regulations of neighboring countries, it is currently common practice at Namibian border control posts to check the custody situation when minor children enter and leave the country. In addition to the passport, people under 18 must have a birth certificate listing their parents. An international birth certificate or, if necessary, a certified English translation is required. To enter and exit the country, unaccompanied minor children require the consent of both parents (“affidavit” in English) that the child can travel alone. The certified copies of both parents' passports must be attached to the affidavit. If a minor is not traveling with both parents with custody, it must also be proven that the parent who is not present either agrees to the trip (affidavit, copy of the passport and contact details of the parent who is not present), or that the declaration of consent is not is required (court order on sole custody or death certificate or negative certificate from the German Youth Welfare Office if the minor lives in Germany). Persons traveling with minors who are not their own children must, in addition to the child's full birth certificate, submit affidavits, copies of passports and the contact details of both parents with legal custody or the child's legal representative. Upon entry, minors traveling alone must also present a confirmation letter including contact details and residential address, a copy of the passport and, if necessary, a copy of the Namibian residence permit of the person to whom the minor is to travel in Namibia. Affidavits require certification by a “commissioner of oaths” (in Namibia), a notary or a Namibian mission abroad. It is strongly recommended to submit declarations, certificates or translations in English. Short-term changes to the regulations or different interpretations by individual departments cannot be ruled out. Detailed and binding information is available from the Namibian Ministry of Home Affairs and Immigration or the Namibian diplomatic mission responsible for the place of residence."", 'Import regulations': 'The import of local currency is possible up to an amount of 50,000 USD, but for an amount of 5,000 NAD or more it must be declared upon entry. Exports for tourists are limited to the amount imported. There are no restrictions on travel between members of the Southern African Customs Union SACU (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland). Hunting weapons must be presented upon entry at a specially designed counter in the baggage collection area of \u200b\u200bthe airport. The number of the weapon is entered into an application form provided there. Based on the application, a temporary weapons license for Namibia will be issued immediately. The import of handguns is not permitted. A valid hunting license from your home country is not required: Foreign hunters are only allowed to hunt together with a Namibian, state-licensed hunting guide or professional hunter. This obtains the necessary hunting permit for the hunters from the Namibian Ministry of Environment and Tourism. When exporting antiques and souvenirs, the provisions of the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Endangered Species (CITES) must be observed. Products derived from animals listed in Annex I to this Convention may not be exported from Namibia. This also applies if they are incorporated into jewelry or clothing (e.g. elephant hair jewelry). Exports of animal products listed in Annex II may be possible with appropriate authorization. Travelers should make sure of this by asking the Namibian authorities or German customs before purchasing. The issuance of an export license from Namibia does not automatically include an import license into Germany. CITES provides further information.'}","{'Vaccination protection': ""There are no compulsory vaccinations required when entering directly from Germany. When entering from a yellow fever area or staying in transit for more than 12 hours in a yellow fever area, all persons aged nine months or older must provide proof of yellow fever vaccination. Namibia itself is not a yellow fever area. Make sure that you and your children's standard vaccinations are up to date according to the Robert Koch Institute's vaccination calendar. Vaccinations against hepatitis A are recommended as travel vaccinations, and for long-term stays or special exposure, also against dengue fever, hepatitis B, typhoid, rabies and meningococcal disease (ACWY). Please note the application instructions and help for the indication in the travel vaccination recommendations. The DTG offers current, detailed travel vaccination recommendations for professionals."", 'Dengue fever': 'Dengue viruses are transmitted by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. There is insufficient data on the prevalence of dengue fever in Namibia, but the risk is suspected to be low. The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches. Complications are very rare among travelers. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. Vaccination is available, see\xa0 Dengue Fever. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis. Get advice from tropical and/or travel doctors regarding vaccination.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a high risk of malaria all year round in the north and northeast of the country (Zambezi/Caprivi Strip, Kavango West, Kavango East, Ohangwena, in the north of Omusati, Oshikoto). There is a high risk of malaria in the Otjozondjupa district in the north-east of the country from September to May, and a low risk from June to August. A low risk exists all year round in the northwest including the Kunene District and Etosha National Park. In the rest of the country, the risk of malaria is minimal. Windhoek, the coast, the Namib Desert and the areas south of Karasburg are considered malaria-free, see DTG Standing Committee on Travel Medicine (StAR). To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'Namibia is one of the countries with the highest HIV prevalence in the world. There is a high risk of infection, particularly through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms, especially with casual acquaintances.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. In recent years there has been a repeated increase in cases of cholera, especially in the densely populated north of the country and in the slums of Windhoek. Travelers are generally not affected. An indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Poisonous animals': 'As in all tropical countries, there are a number of sometimes dangerous venomous snakes in Namibia, whose bite can cause serious physical damage, including death. Overall, however, snakebites are uncommon and rarely occur unprovoked. There are also some poisonous species of spiders and scorpions. Do not walk around at night with your legs uncovered as many snakes are nocturnal. Do not reach into holes or crevices in the ground, under stones or brushwood or similar confusing material. Before use, shake out duvets and sheets, clothing, footwear and headgear.', 'African tick bite fever': 'After malaria, the most common febrile infectious disease caused by a stay in African national parks is African tick-bite fever. The pathogen, Rickettsia africae, is transmitted by ticks that are sometimes very aggressive when they are unprotected in grass and savanna landscapes. The disease is characterized by fever, headache and body aches and later by a skin rash (exanthema). The blood-encrusted puncture site (Eschar), which is often not noticed at first, is characteristic. Doxycycline for treatment is very effective. To avoid tick-borne diseases, consistently protect yourself from tick bites as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever': 'This rare hemorrhagic viral disease occurs sporadically in Namibia. The virus is mainly transmitted by ticks of the genus Hyalomma or through contact with the flesh or blood of infected animals; the disease may also occur through close contact with infected people in health facilities. The infection is accompanied by a high fever, a pronounced feeling of illness and a tendency to bleed. To avoid tick-borne diseases, consistently protect yourself from tick bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. Avoid contact with raw meat.', 'Anthrax': 'Occasionally, outbreaks of the animal disease anthrax (anthrax) occur in the northeast/Caprivi, as in other animal-rich areas of southern Africa. Hippos and buffaloes as well as farm animals are particularly affected. In the event of direct contact, the pathogen can also be dangerous for people (especially farm workers). Stay away from dead animals on safaris.', 'Other health risks': 'UV radiation in Namibia is very high. To protect the skin and eyes, sun protection such as clothing, a hat, sunglasses and sunblock with a high sun protection factor are absolutely necessary.', 'Air pollution': 'Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual.', 'Medical care': 'Medical care in the country is not always comparable to that in Europe; in rural areas it can be technically and technically problematic, and hygienic standards are not always sufficient. In Windhoek and the larger cities there is good outpatient and inpatient care in the private sector, similar to Germany.

Please note the application instructions and help for the indication in the travel vaccination recommendations. The DTG offers current, detailed travel vaccination recommendations for professionals."", 'Dengue fever': 'Dengue viruses are transmitted nationwide by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. Autochthonous transmissions have also been proven in Kathmandu (altitude above sea level 1,400 m). The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches and is increasingly affecting travelers. In rare cases, serious complications, including possible death, occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see dengue fever. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis. Get advice from tropical and/or travel doctors regarding vaccination.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. Below 2,000 meters there is a low risk of malaria transmission all year round in Nepal, especially in the Terai districts near India and the Chitwan National Park. Kathmandu, Pokhara and the Himalayas at altitudes above 2,000 m are considered malaria-free. The proportion of malaria tertiana ( P. vivax ) is 91%, malaria tropica cases ( P. falciparum ) occur in 9%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Under normal conditions (travel duration of up to 4 weeks, hotel accommodation with air conditioning, informed and cautious traveler), no medical malaria prophylaxis is recommended.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms, especially with casual acquaintances.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Japanese encephalitis': 'Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an inflammation of the brain caused by viruses. These are transmitted by nocturnal mosquitoes. Pigs and waterfowl in particular are infected with the virus without becoming ill themselves. Diseases in humans are rare, but are often severe and often leave lasting damage or are fatal. There are no effective medications against the JE viruses, see\xa0Japanese encephalitis. In Nepal, there is a risk of transmission of JE in the southern parts of the country; isolated cases have also occurred in the Kathmandu Valley. To avoid Japanese encephalitis, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially at night, as part of exposure prophylaxis and get vaccinated.', 'rabies': 'Rabies is a regularly fatal infectious disease that is caused by viruses that are transmitted in the saliva of infected animals or people (through bites, licking of injured skin areas or droplets of saliva on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes). There is a high risk of bites from stray dogs and the transmission of rabies across the country. Monkeys can also carry rabies and should never be fed. The necessary medical measures after a bite from an unvaccinated person are not always possible in Nepal. Vaccination before a bite offers reliable protection against the disease. This is why a preventive rabies vaccination is particularly important when traveling to Nepal. It should definitely be completed before you travel. The immediate “refresher” that is necessary even after a bite can then be carried out on site if necessary, see Rabies.', 'Tuberculosis': 'Tuberculosis is much more common nationwide than in Central Europe. Transmission occurs from person to person via droplet infection or close contact. Due to improper or canceled treatments, there are increasingly resistant tuberculosis pathogens in Nepal. Wearing a surgical mask does not protect against infection.', 'Avian influenza (bird flu)': 'Cases of avian influenza have been reported in Nepal since 2019. Human-to-human transmission has not yet been proven. See also avian influenza. Please note the information published by the Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection for travelers on bird flu.', 'Geographically related diseases': 'Nepal is a popular destination for trekking tourists who climb to high altitudes. There is often not enough time for gradual height adjustment. Various forms of acute altitude sickness are possible, see altitude sickness. Before traveling to high altitudes (above 2,300 m), seek individual advice from a doctor experienced in high-altitude medicine before finalizing your travel plans. Travel health insurance that covers the risk of mountains (e.g. helicopter evacuation) is strongly recommended. There are several civil air rescue companies in Nepal for helicopter rescue from mountain emergencies. However, due to the weather, the aircraft are not always ready for use. Depending on the location of the accident, the alarm can often only be triggered with a delay. In any case, the assumption of costs for a rescue must be clarified before the start of the rescue operation, otherwise they may have to be borne by the injured person themselves. Intense sunlight, glare from snow and ice, strong winds, extreme cold, and rough or unfamiliar terrain pose additional risks for travelers\xa0at high altitudes. Earthquakes or persistent rainfall can cause avalanches, mudslides and entire mountain slopes to slide in vulnerable areas.', 'Other health risks': 'Patients with mental illnesses are strongly advised not to stop taking their medication before or during a trip to Nepal. Psychiatric and German-speaking care like in your home country can usually not be guaranteed. In addition, many travel health insurance policies do not cover medical services for mental illnesses. In such cases, a spontaneous flight home is often impossible, as many commercial airlines refuse to take unstable patients with mental illnesses without psychiatric support. If necessary, please discuss your travel plans in detail with your doctor.', 'Air pollution': 'Forest fires can cause health problems due to air pollution/particulate matter, especially in the dry months (November - May). People with previous lung diseases are particularly at risk. Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual.', 'Medical care': 'Medical care is inadequate in large parts of the country and often does not meet European standards. Sufficient basic supplies exist in Kathmandu and the common tourist destinations, including along the major trekking routes. In Kathmandu, medical care in individual specialist areas is also at a high level. In the case of serious illnesses, medical evacuation, for example to Kathmandu or further to India, may have to be considered. The supply of reliable medication and an uninterrupted cold chain are not always guaranteed. It must be expected that fake products will be sold instead of real medication, especially in small pharmacies. Numerous resistances to commonly used antibiotics are occurring across the country. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG.

The number of fatal traffic accidents has increased significantly in recent years. An increasing number of young tourists were among those who died in accidents. In order to reduce the number of accidents involving foreign drivers, numerous vehicle rental companies have adopted a self-imposed code of conduct. Before taking delivery of the vehicle, foreign customers are not only comprehensively informed about New Zealand road traffic regulations, but are also asked about their level of preparation for driving in New Zealand and their driving experience. The code of conduct stipulates that the rental can ultimately be refused if necessary.

Please follow the recommendations for your trip, see Zika virus infection.', 'Dengue fever': 'Dengue viruses are transmitted nationwide by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches and is increasingly affecting travelers. In rare cases, serious complications, including possible death, occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see dengue fever. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis. Get advice from tropical and/or travel doctors regarding vaccination.', 'Chikungunya fever': 'Chikungunya viruses are transmitted by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is characterized by high fever and possibly prolonged joint and muscle pain. The symptoms often cannot be clearly distinguished from other mosquito-borne diseases. Chikungunya fever does not always heal without consequences; long-lasting rheumatism-like symptoms rarely occur. There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. A high risk of malaria exists all year round in the northern parts of the country in the autonomous Atlantic provinces and Miskito Cay (“Mosquito Island”). A medium risk exists in the remaining autonomous Atlantic provinces, in the northeast of the Jinotega province and in the south of the Rio San Juan province. There is a low risk in the rest of the country including Corn Islands. The city of Managua is malaria-free. The proportion of malaria tropica ( P. falciparum ) and mixed infections is 55%, 45% are malaria tertiana cases ( P. vivax ). The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications are available for this (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine). Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases can be prevented through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Trypanosomiasis („Chagas disease“)': 'In Nicaragua, American trypanosomiasis (Chagas) can be transmitted through the excretions of predatory bugs that live in cracks in simple dwellings in rural areas. These can be ingested through the bite of infected bugs or, more rarely, through contaminated fruit or sugar cane juices. In the acute phase of the disease, flu-like symptoms and possibly swelling of the eyelid are the main symptoms. Up to years after the infection, serious organ changes in the heart and digestive tract can occur. Overall, the risk for travelers of contracting Chagas is very low. Use correctly installed bed nets to protect against bites.', 'rabies': 'Rabies is a fatal infectious disease caused by viruses that are transmitted in the saliva of infected animals or people. Avoid contact with animals. Get advice about a rabies vaccination and get vaccinated. The vaccination series should definitely be completed before you travel. Even if you have already been vaccinated, consult a doctor immediately after contact with a potentially infected animal or person (bite, licking of injured skin areas or droplets of saliva on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes).', 'Leishmaniasis': 'Cutaneous leishmaniasis in particular is common in rural areas. This is a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies with skin changes that usually only appear weeks to months after the bite and persist for a long time. In the case of persistent, unclear fever attacks and enlargement of the spleen, the dangerous, generalized (so-called “visceral”) form can also be present. Protect yourself adequately from sand flies as part of exposure prophylaxis. If you have non-healing skin ulcers or persistent bouts of fever, please go to a clinic with experience in tropical medicine.', 'Flu (Seasonal Influenza)': 'Seasonal influenza viruses, including influenza A/H1N1 (“swine flu”), circulate in Nicaragua primarily during the winter months.

This bacterial infection usually progresses like a mild flu-like infection, but in rare cases it can also lead to serious liver and kidney involvement. If exposure is expected in individual cases, consider drug prophylaxis with doxycycline after careful risk assessment by a travel or tropical medicine specialist.', 'Medical care': 'In Nicaragua, health care, especially in rural areas, often does not meet the technical and hygienic standards in Germany. The costs for medical treatment and medication usually have to be paid immediately on site in cash or by credit card. It is therefore recommended that you carry a sufficiently covered credit card with you. In recent months, several cases have become known in which, despite an emergency, urgently necessary treatments or operations were not carried out until the cost issue was clarified. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad.

Particular vigilance and caution is recommended. In 2022 there was another explosive attack on the train route from Abuja to Kaduna, in which several train passengers died or were kidnapped. We therefore warn against using the train connection. Busy places such as markets, mosques, churches, hotels, shopping centers and transport hubs such as bus stations and large taxi ranks that do not have reliable security present an increased risk of attacks. The risk of terrorist or criminal-motivated kidnapping is high, with Borno, Yobe, Sokoto, Katsina, Zamfara, Jigawa and the northern part of Adamawa State having a very high risk of kidnapping. If possible, avoid traveling in the country by land and definitely avoid traveling after dark. If travel by land is unavoidable, carefully check the security situation on the planned route before and during the trip and carry it out with an armed escort (e.g. Mobile Police, MoPol). Pay particular attention in busy places and on special occasions and when visiting public or publicly accessible facilities and places and avoid large crowds of people. Please note the global safety notice.', 'Domestic political situation': 'In Nigeria, unpredictable local conflicts can break out in all regions. Causes and causes of conflicts can be political, economic, religious, social and/or ethnic. In particular, the states of Zamfara, western Taraba, the eastern part of Nassarawa, northern Sokoto and the states of Plateau, Kaduna, Benue, Niger and Kebbi are currently affected by armed conflicts/intra-ethnic conflicts between nomadic pastoralists and sedentary farmers as well as organized criminal gangs . There are currently increasing numbers of armed attacks on state security force institutions in the southeastern and southern states of Imo, Rivers, Anambra, Enugu, Ebonyi and Akwa-Ibom. The Nigeria Police Force has commenced “Operation Restore Peace” in these states in 2021 following a significant increase in security incidents. This can lead to a higher police presence locally. Street controls through checkpoints and restrictive measures by security forces often take place across the country. In individual states, short-term (nightly) curfews are also imposed. Demonstrations and protests are particularly possible in Abuja and Lagos, but also other large cities, and can lead to violent clashes. In 2020, these caused numerous deaths in Abuja, Lagos and other cities. Check local media and be sure to follow regional curfews. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces.', 'crime': ""The crime rate in Nigeria is very high, and the general security situation has steadily deteriorated in recent years. In large parts of the country, there are incalculable risks to life and limb from threats, blackmail, robbery, kidnapping and murder, particularly when traveling overland. Criminal acts are often committed by “false uniforms,” i.e. criminals posing as police officers or soldiers. Armed attacks occur again and again in the economic metropolis of Lagos, including in the urban areas of Victoria Island, Ikoyi, Lekki and Ikeja, which are preferred by foreigners. Criminal incidents such as house break-ins and robberies are also recorded in Abuja and other major cities in the country. The risk of kidnapping is very high in Borno, Yobe, Sokoto, Katsina, Zamfara, Jigawa and the northern part of Adamawa State, while the risk of kidnapping is high in the remaining states. When traveling overland and on routes between airports and city centers, violent attacks must be expected, even during the day. Travelers were also repeatedly attacked on the long connecting roads between the international airports and the inner cities of Lagos, Abuja and Port Harcourt. There is a risk of piracy throughout the Gulf of Guinea. There are gang activities and attacks on coastal towns, fishing boats, oil tankers or oil platforms with hostage-taking. The river basins of Delta, Bayelsa, Rivers, Akwa Ibom and Cross Rivers State are also affected. The German representations in Nigeria provide detailed information on the so-called advance payment fraud (scam). Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Protect cash, photographic equipment and other valuables from third parties. Avoid wearing jewelry, valuable watches, etc., especially in public places/markets. . Only use registered taxis or hotel vehicles. Avoid driving at night. For unavoidable night journeys, always use a well-secured or, even better, armored vehicle and an armed escort (e.g. Mobile Police; MoPol). For unavoidable journeys by land, carefully check the security situation on the planned route and, if possible, carry it out with an armed escort ( e.g. MoPol). Do not resist in the event of an armed robbery and hand over valuables. Be skeptical of unusual emails, telephone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances and do not make any payments/transfers without careful checking. Do not travel to Nigeria based on dubious business or other contacts, especially online acquaintances.""}","{'General information': 'The climate in the south of Nigeria is tropical and the coast is warm and humid.

Tropical cyclones can hit the Omani coast from the Indian Ocean and cause storms and heavy rain to cause floods and landslides, which subsequently lead to damage to infrastructure and disruption to travel. Dangerous ocean currents lead to tragic drowning accidents on the coast. Follow weather reports and warnings such as those from the Public Authority for Civil Aviation.

Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Do not allow children to play unsupervised on beaches.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'The condition of the roads is usually good. However, considering the low population density and the vastness of the country, the traffic accident rate, even with fatal outcomes, is relatively high. Journeys over longer distances, especially on the 1000 km long route between Muscat and Salalah, which leads over long stretches through monotonous desert landscapes, are often underestimated. Speeding is commonplace, especially outside of cities. Highways sometimes run on raised embankments due to the risk of flooding. Flooding can quickly make other roads impassable. When traveling outside the greater Muscat area, there is an increased risk of accidents, especially in the dark, also due to free-roaming camels. In remote regions it can take several hours for an accident rescue service to arrive. Given the current situation in Yemen, increased road checks by police/military can be expected on overland journeys throughout the Sultanate of Oman. Rental cars are not always adequately insured, especially when it comes to passenger protection. When traveling to the United Arab Emirates, the insurance must also be valid there. There are strict traffic controls. Traffic violations such as speeding, using a cell phone and driving in danger zones (such as dry rivers when there is a risk of flooding) can result in harsh penalties, including imprisonment. Hiking trails both in the mountains and in the wadis are largely unsecured and can prove to be extremely dangerous. Hikes at popular tourist destinations (Wadi Shab, Wadi Bani Khalid, etc.) can sometimes lead through terrain that is so steep or sloping that even a small amount of carelessness in the wrong place can be fatal. Always drive defensively and with foresight in traffic. Pay attention to insurance conditions when renting a car. On long desert tours, take the usual precautions, take regular breaks and plan overnight stays well in advance. Avoid driving outside Muscat after dark. If possible, go on trips to the desert, wadis and mountains with a tour operator, always with several people, with at least one other off-road vehicle and with an ample supply of petrol and drinking water. Take appropriate emergency equipment (first aid, cell phone, winch, provisions) and tracking devices (GPS if possible). For off-road tours, you should leave itinerary and the expected time of return with the hotel or host. Be particularly careful when hiking in wadis.', ""Driver's license"": ""Even if the German driving license is generally sufficient for tourists to rent a rental car, an international driving license is recommended, but is only valid in conjunction with the German driving license.

Pregnancies outside of marriage and the birth of children out of wedlock are illegal in Oman. The sentence corresponds to the statements on sexual intercourse outside of marriage. The possession, importation and trafficking of (illegal) drugs are punished severely under criminal law. Drug trafficking carries the death penalty. Consuming alcohol in public (e.g. on public beaches) is also strictly prohibited and punishable by non-Muslims. The importation of painkillers as well as hallucinogenic drugs, antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs without a multilingual medical certificate can be considered a criminal offense, as a number of these drugs are considered illegal drugs in Oman, the possession and importation of which is punishable.

In general, people should not be photographed without asking. Police, military and border stations as well as soldiers and police officers are not allowed to be photographed. The import and use of drones requires the express prior authorization of the Omani authorities. Violators face confiscation, prosecution and arrest. The use of VPN networks is controlled and can lead to criminal prosecution. The export of cultural goods - including geological, archaeological or maritime finds - is a criminal offense. Violations of Omani road traffic rules can result in a temporary arrest. In the event of a traffic accident resulting in personal injury, an arrest will always be made and the passport will be retained.

Even if these are initially peaceful, they can lead to violent clashes and traffic disruptions and become the target of terrorist attacks. In Balochistan and in the so-called “newly merged districts” (NMDs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, there are repeated armed clashes between security forces and militant groups, to which even uninvolved civilians can fall victim. Large parts of these areas are closed to foreigners. The Pakistani authorities do not post an up-to-date list of areas closed to foreigners on the Internet. For some of these areas, official travel permits can be requested from Pakistani authorities. Applying for such a permit is usually very time-consuming. If you stay in such areas without the necessary authorization, you risk being detained for several days. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Obey barricades and stay away from restricted areas without proper permits. Follow the instructions of local security forces."", 'Border areas with Afghanistan, Iran and India': 'The border areas with Afghanistan, Iran and India are not accessible or only accessible with official permission; Prohibition zones of different widths apply along the borders. This also applies to the Pakistan-administered part of Kashmir (Azad Jammu and Kashmir) along the ceasefire line (“Line of Control” (LoC)) and to other regions of the country. There is a travel warning for Afghanistan. There is an express warning against entering and leaving the Pakistani border with Iran due to the risk of kidnapping in the Iranian-Pakistani border area and because of the existing travel warning for the province of Balochistan. The German representations in Pakistan do not issue letters of recommendation in connection with obtaining visas for the aforementioned countries. Appropriate visas should be obtained from the diplomatic missions of these countries in Germany before starting your journey. Find out about local media. Before traveling to Gilgit-Baltistan, please check the current security situation with Pakistani tour operators and authorities. If you travel to the mountainous north of Pakistan, you should preferably travel by air (Gilgit and Skardu airports), but also expect short-term flight cancellations due to weather. When traveling by land, find out in advance from the Pakistani authorities whether you need to apply for an official permit (“Non-Objection Certificate” (NOC)) for your travel route or destination and, if necessary, submit the relevant applications as early as possible.', 'crime': ""Crime is increasing overall, especially in big cities. Violent crime (robbery, murder) is observed throughout the country, particularly in Balochistan and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, as well as in major cities, particularly Karachi. Petty crime, particularly pickpocketing and other street crimes, occurs in the big cities, including in the districts inhabited by foreigners and especially in Karachi. Pedestrians are easy victims in the dark. Passports, credit cards and mobile devices are often sought-after stolen items; Credit card fraud is not uncommon. Withdrawals from ATMs and stopping at large intersections at night are considered dangerous; It is not uncommon for robberies to occur. It is customary for short stays, for example by business travelers, artists or SES experts in Karachi, to be accompanied by reliable local partners who are familiar with the area. Kidnappings of foreigners recently occurred in Balochistan and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In general, it is recommended that visitors coordinate their travel plans closely with local partners. If possible, coordinate travel plans carefully with local partners. If possible, avoid walking in cities after dark and avoid showing valuables in public during the day. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports, train stations and on public transport and look after your valuables. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'In the south there is a tropical, humid maritime climate, in the north there is a continental climate with cool winters and hot summers. During the main monsoon season (June to September), heavy rainfall often triggers floods and landslides, particularly in the mountainous parts of the country and also near the coast. This can make roads temporarily impassable, train connections interrupted or individual places temporarily no longer accessible. Pakistan is located in a seismically active zone, so there is a risk of earthquakes. During the monsoon season, pay attention to the weather forecasts and always observe advisories, warnings and instructions from local authorities. Familiarize yourself with what to do during earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.

While a more tolerant attitude towards foreign customs can sometimes be observed in large cities, it is important to pay attention to appropriate clothing and appearance, especially when traveling overland, in order to take into account the often religious-conservative basic attitude of the population. People should only be photographed cautiously and their consent should be asked beforehand. When the authorities deal with foreign visitors, a rather restrictive interpretation and application of the rules on stay and freedom of movement in the country can be observed out of mistrust, but also to protect travelers. In such cases, the German diplomatic missions abroad can only exert very limited influence on the relevant Pakistani authorities.

The main transmission time is July to November. The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches and is increasingly affecting travelers. In rare cases, serious complications, including possible death, occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see dengue fever. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis. Get advice from tropical and/or travel doctors regarding vaccination.', 'Chikungunya fever': 'Chikungunya viruses are transmitted by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is increasingly common during and immediately after the rainy season in the populous coastal region around Karachi and is characterized by high fever and possibly prolonged joint and muscle pain. The symptoms often cannot be clearly distinguished from other mosquito-borne diseases. Chikungunya fever does not always heal without consequences; long-lasting rheumatism-like symptoms rarely occur. There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Below an altitude of 2,500 m, there is a high risk of malaria transmission from May to November and a low risk of malaria transmission from December to April in the northern and northwestern provinces, the western part of Punjab and parts of the south of the country in Pakistan. In the remaining areas in the south and southwest there is a low risk below 2,500 m altitude, see maps from the DTG Standing Committee on Travel Medicine (StAR). In around a quarter of the cases it is the potentially life-threatening malaria tropica. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. The risk of infection with salmonella, shigella and typhoid fever, amoeba, lamblia and worm diseases exists nationwide. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Typhus': 'Typhoid fever is a bacterial infectious disease caused by Salmonella (S.) typhi. People suffering from typhoid fever have a high fever, which sets in 6-30 days after infection and can rise continuously to 40° Celsius over 3-4 days. It is accompanied by headaches, nausea, loss of appetite and fatigue. Sometimes typical rashes (“roseolas”) appear on the skin; purulent abscesses form in internal organs, see typhus. Typhoid fever is common in Pakistan and epidemics occur from time to time. In 2019, infections showed resistance to several common antibiotics. Correct behavior also helps to prevent typhus and other infections with fecal-oral transmission: Wash your hands as often as possible, especially after each use of the toilet. Avoid foods that have not been freshly cooked and drinking water that has not been prepared correctly.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. It occurs in Pakistan mainly after floods, but is usually not a problem for travelers. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Poliomyelitis (child paralysis)': 'Pakistan is one of the few countries in the world where poliovirus infections are still being reported. Transmission occurs through fecally contaminated drinking water or food. If you are traveling for less than four weeks, make sure you are fully vaccinated against poliomyelitis. Booster vaccinations are necessary every ten years. If you are traveling and staying in the country for longer periods of more than four weeks, you should also be vaccinated against poliomyelitis with one dose four weeks to 12 months before you leave the country again. The vaccination must be certified separately in the international vaccination certificate. See also\xa0 Poliomyelitis.', 'rabies': 'Rabies is a fatal infectious disease caused by viruses that are transmitted in the saliva of infected animals or people. There is a high risk of bite injuries from stray dogs and monkeys across the country. The necessary medical measures after bite injuries in unvaccinated people are not always possible in Pakistan outside of the big cities, e.g. on the trekking routes in the Karakoram Mountains, see Rabies. Avoid contact with animals. Get advice about a rabies vaccination and get vaccinated. The vaccination series should definitely be completed before you travel. Even if you have already been vaccinated, consult a doctor immediately after contact with a potentially infected animal or person (bite, licking of injured skin areas or droplets of saliva on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose and eyes).', 'Leishmaniasis': 'Cutaneous leishmaniasis in particular is common in rural areas. This is a parasitic disease transmitted by sand flies with skin changes that usually only appear weeks to months after the bite and persist for a long time. In the case of persistent, unclear attacks of fever and enlargement of the spleen, the dangerous, generalized (so-called “visceral”) form can also be present. Protect yourself adequately from sand flies as part of exposure prophylaxis. If you have non-healing skin ulcers or persistent bouts of fever, please go to a clinic with experience in tropical medicine.', 'Tuberculosis': 'Tuberculosis is much more common nationwide than in Central Europe. Transmission occurs from person to person via droplet infection or close contact. Due to improper or discontinued treatments, there are increasing numbers of resistant and multi-resistant tuberculosis pathogens.', 'Japanese encephalitis': 'Japanese encephalitis (JE) is an inflammation of the brain caused by viruses. These are transmitted by nocturnal mosquitoes. Pigs and waterfowl in particular are infected with the virus without becoming ill themselves. There is a low risk of transmission of JE in Pakistan in the Indus Delta and Sindh province, in the southeast of the country. Diseases in humans are rare, but are often severe and often leave lasting damage or are fatal. There are no effective medications against the JE viruses, see also Japanese encephalitis. To avoid Japanese encephalitis, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis and, if necessary, get vaccinated.', 'Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever': 'This viral disease, which is transmitted by ticks on infected animals, is regularly observed in all parts of the country during two peaks (March to May and August to October). People who have close contact with animals (farmers, butchers, etc.) are predominantly affected. Avoid close contact with animals.', 'Geographically related diseases': 'Northern Pakistan is currently a rather rare destination for trekking tourists. When staying above 2,300 m altitude, adjustment disorders and various forms of altitude sickness can occur in isolated cases, especially if altitude tactical principles are ignored, see altitude sickness. Before traveling to high altitudes (above 2,300 m), seek individual advice from a doctor experienced in high-altitude medicine before finalizing your travel plans. Travel health insurance that covers the risk of mountains (e.g. helicopter evacuation) is strongly recommended. Intense sunlight, glare from snow and ice, strong winds, extreme cold and impassable or unknown terrain pose additional risks for travelers at high altitudes. Earthquakes or persistent rainfall can cause avalanches, mudslides and entire mountain slopes to slide in vulnerable areas. As far as the embassy is aware, there are no civilian air rescue companies in Pakistan for helicopter rescue from mountain emergencies, but only the option of evacuation by the Pakistani military, which is very bureaucratic and time-consuming. Depending on the location of the accident, the alert can be very delayed.', 'Medical care': 'Medical care is inadequate in large parts of the country and usually does not meet European standards in terms of medical, hygiene, technology and organization. Language barriers can make communication significantly more difficult, especially in rural areas. In Islamabad and Karachi, medical care in all disciplines is usually of a high standard and therefore expensive. The supply of reliable medication and an uninterrupted cold chain are not guaranteed everywhere. It must be expected that counterfeit products will also be sold, especially in small pharmacies. Travelers should bring sufficient quantities of regular medication with them to Pakistan and have their doctor certify the need for it in English before entering the country. The pharmacies of large private clinics offer a wide range of reliable medications. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go.

Be particularly careful in Panama City and avoid walking after dark or visiting slums. Only take organized shore excursions in Colon and avoid exploring the city and port area on your own. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. In the event of a robbery, do not resist, but have a small amount of money ready to hand over and, if necessary, hand over valuables. Only take registered taxis and pre-order them; do not hail them on the street. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports, bus stations and on buses and look after your valuables. Do not anchor boats freely near the coast, but rather use guarded harbor facilities. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'Tropical storms The climate is tropical. May to November is hurricane season. During this time, tropical storms and intense rainfall, landslides and floods are to be expected, which can also significantly affect travel. Earthquakes Panama is located in a seismically active zone, which is why earthquakes can occur. Flood waves in rivers Unpredictable rainfall can lead to strong flood waves and endanger bathers in rivers and streams. During hurricane season, regularly monitor weather reports and pay attention to storm warnings from the National Hurricane Center. In the event of a storm warning, please note the information on hurricanes abroad or the information from the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance. Avoid swimming in rivers. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. Familiarize yourself with what to do during earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'There is an internal flight network and extensive bus connections. There are taxis and rental cars in the cities. There is a railway line between Panama City and Colon, but it is only usable for passenger traffic on weekdays, and there are occasional disruptions due to demonstrations. The road network can be classified as good in regional comparison. Most parts of the “Panamericana” stretching from Panama City along the Pacific coast to the Costa Rican border are in good condition. Away from the main roads, there are only a few asphalt roads left; After a few kilometers these occasionally turn into unpaved paths and then prove to be impassable during the long rainy season. The east of the country is hardly developed in terms of transport; the Pan-American Highway (asphalted part) ends well before the border with Colombia. Buses run regularly to all major towns in the country. In isolated cases, roads in the highlands of Chiriqui, Veraguas and Bocas Del Toro may be severely damaged as a result of flooding. It is advisable to inquire in advance whether the destination in these provinces can be reached by land. Traveling on the ""Panamericana"" Road closures often occur on the ""Panamericana"" in particular due to protests or demonstrations. The blockages usually last several hours and sometimes even days and can therefore significantly affect travel. Before traveling, check with officials and local media about possible closures. If the ""Pan-American Highway"" is blocked, avoid interactions with demonstrators as these can lead to conflict situations. Carry enough water and food in the vehicle. In the event of a robbery, do not resist, have a small amount of money ready to hand over and, if necessary, hand over valuables. Please also note the travel and safety instructions for the neighboring countries through which the ""Panamericana"" passes.', ""Driver's license"": 'Tourists are allowed to drive in Panama with a valid German driving license for a stay of up to 90 days. For a longer period of time, it is necessary to convert to a Panamanian driving license.', 'LGBTIQ': 'Homosexuality is not a crime in Panama. However, social acceptance is not widespread. Hostility can arise, particularly in rural areas. Please note the general information for LGBTIQ.', 'Legal specifics': 'Drug possession and trafficking are also punishable offenses in Panama and are prosecuted by the local authorities. If arrested, drastic prison sentences can be expected in the country, even for small quantities. Even if you are simply suspected of carrying illegal substances, you can expect an arrest by the police authorities. The subsequent review may take several days. During this time, detention is the norm. In the autonomous comarca of Kuna Yala, jurisdiction is administered by the tribal chiefs in accordance with indigenous law. This can lead to severe penalties even for minor incidents. Boat owners must also obtain a permit from the Congreso General Guna and the Panamanian Migration Agency before entering the waters of the Comarca. Consuming alcoholic beverages in public is prohibited and may result in imprisonment. Smoking is banned in many public spaces and is generally frowned upon within Panamanian society. Violating the smoking ban can result in fines.', 'Money/credit cards': 'The public currency in Panama is the Balboa (PAB), which is pegged to the USD at a ratio of 1:1. The PAB only exists in the form of coins; otherwise payment is made in USD notes. In hotels and shops in Panama City and the larger cities in the interior, you can usually pay with international credit cards, including Eurocard/Mastercard and especially VISA. EUR can hardly be exchanged. It is therefore advisable to carry USD in cash with you. The use of bank (Maestro) cards does not always work without problems. Most ATMs only allow a limited amount to be withdrawn per transaction and a transaction fee is charged. Money transfers can be initiated within a short period of time via the relevant internationally operating financial transaction service providers; there are branches all over the country.'}","{'General information': 'Entry and customs regulations for German citizens can change at short notice without the Foreign Office being informed in advance.

The requirements of individual airlines regarding the documents their passengers must carry sometimes differ from government regulations. Travelers should\xa0check with their airline before traveling if necessary."", 'A view': ""German citizens do not need a visa to enter the country and stay for up to 90 days. In individual cases, the Panamanian border authorities may limit the permitted stay period to up to 15 days. Either a return ticket to Germany or a valid onward travel ticket (land/air) must be presented. In addition, it must be proven that the legal entry requirements for the country of onward travel are also met. Sufficient financial resources for the stay must be proven. This means either USD 1,000 in cash or the availability of the corresponding amount on the credit card account (proven by credit card statement). Entry by sea Special regulations apply to entry and exit from Panama on ships of any kind (sailing ships, yachts, catamarans, etc.): An entry fee is charged upon entry. Tourists only receive a visa for 72 hours when entering the country by ship. If you want to stay in Panama for longer than 72 hours, you should contact the responsible migration authority at the port of landing to find out how a regular tourist visa can be obtained. A stay in Panama beyond the permitted visa period will be punished as a violation of the residence law with heavy fines and, if necessary, expulsion from the country. When entering the territory of Guna Yala (San Blas Islands) by sea, it is important to ensure that your passport is properly stamped by the immigration authorities (Migración). Otherwise, travelers can be treated as illegal immigrants. If there is no official from the migration authority on site when arriving by ship, it is the traveler's responsibility to ask for the office of the migration authority and to obtain an entry stamp immediately, even if entering the country by private ship/at a very early and late hour. Once the traveler is in the country (e.g. in Panama City), this formality can no longer be repeated and the traveler is invariably considered illegal. Entry from Costa Rica When entering Panama from Costa Rica by land, it is important to ensure that both the Costa Rican exit stamp and the Panamanian entry stamp are affixed to the passport. Travelers must first purchase tax stamps from the municipality (Municipalidad) and then get an entry stamp at a separate immigration counter (Migración). In general, travelers should always check whether they have received an entry stamp and, if necessary, request it. Without an entry stamp in your passport, you must expect considerable difficulties when leaving the country or during road checks. Since this is a violation of the law, it is punishable by imprisonment and payment of a very large fine as well as expulsion from Panama. Entry and exit via the USA (also applies to San Juan/Puerto Rico) or via Canada When entering and exiting via the USA, the entry regulations for the USA must be observed; when entering and leaving via Canada, the entry regulations for Canada must be observed. Longer-term stay For longer stays (internships, volunteer assignments, starting work, etc.) you should contact the Panamanian embassy in Berlin in good time. Information is available from the Panama Migration Authority. It should be noted that German citizens who wish to stay in the country for longer than the period permitted upon entry must necessarily apply for a corresponding residence permit (Residencia). The Panamanian migration authority is increasingly monitoring compliance with residence regulations. Foreigners living in Panama without a valid residence permit may be refused re-entry into Panama if they leave the country, even if they have sufficient cash."", 'ID requirement': 'Foreigners are required to provide ID in Panama.

There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a moderate year-round risk of malaria in parts of the provinces east of the Panama Canal. In the provinces west of the canal, including the islands of San Blas, Bastimentos, Parida and Colón, there is a minimal risk all year round. Panama City, the Canal Zone, the islands of Coiba, Cebaco and Pearl Islands are considered malaria-free. The proportion of malaria tertiana ( P. vivax ) is over 99%, less than 1% are malaria tropica cases ( P. falciparum ). DTG provides a map. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, emergency self-treatment (NSB) may also make sense in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis.

To avoid leishmaniasis, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Leptospirosis': 'Leptospirosis can occasionally be transmitted year-round through water contaminated with rodent excrement. The bacterial infection usually progresses like a mild flu-like infection, but in rare cases it can also lead to serious involvement of the liver and kidneys. If exposure is expected, drug prophylaxis with doxycycline can be considered in individual cases after careful risk assessment by a travel or tropical medicine specialist, see Leptospirosis.', 'Hantavirus': 'This rare viral disease is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated secretions from infected rodents via the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. After two to four weeks you may experience flu-like symptoms such as headaches and body aches. In rare cases, fatal complications can arise from infection of the kidneys or cardiopulmonary system. There is no vaccination or drug prophylaxis, see Hantavirus. Avoid contact with rodent droppings.', 'Trypanosomiasis („Chagas disease“)': 'In Panama, American trypanosomiasis (Chagas) can be transmitted through the excretions of predatory bugs that live in cracks in simple dwellings in rural areas. These can be ingested through the bite of infected bugs or, more rarely, through contaminated fruit or sugar cane juices. In the acute phase of the disease, flu-like symptoms and possibly swelling of the eyelid are the main symptoms. Up to years after the infection, serious organ changes in the heart and digestive tract can occur. Overall, the risk for travelers of contracting Chagas is very low. Use correctly installed bed nets to protect against bites.', 'Medical care': 'Overall, health care, especially in rural areas, is often not comparable to European technical and hygienic standards. Plannable interventions should therefore take place in Germany if possible. The costs for medical treatment and medication usually have to be paid immediately on site in cash (credit card payment is also possible).

In 2022, the security situation was repeatedly severely affected due to political upheavals during the national elections. Other political events can also trigger similar violent riots at any time. In the mining provinces of Southern Highlands, Enga and Hela, there have been regular clashes within the local population since 2017, and a state of emergency has been declared in some cases. There is always the possibility of violent riots at demonstrations and gatherings of large groups of people. In an emergency situation, help from security forces is often only available to a limited extent. Find out about local media. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces.', 'crime': ""Overall, crime in Papua New Guinea is very high. In addition to Port Moresby, Lae and Mount Hagen and the highlands as a whole (large parts of the Southern and Western Highlands, Hela and Enga provinces) are particularly affected. The number of armed robberies in public places and accommodation as well as break-ins and carjackings on the road (carjacking) is high. The increased availability of drugs makes dangerous situations even more unpredictable. In February 2023, there was a kidnapping with a ransom demand in the border area between Hela and Southern Province. Robberies - most recently in May 2023 - also pose a danger, especially in the highlands. Perpetrators show a high level of violence, including homicide. A lack of infrastructure and communication options, especially in remote areas, makes it significantly more difficult to request or provide help in dangerous situations. Violent attacks have also occurred in areas frequented by tourists or in national parks in the past, as well as on the Kokoda Track and the Black Cat Track. The number of reports of targeted rape is increasing; Women traveling alone are particularly at risk. Due to the risk of contracting the HIV virus, victims of violent crimes, especially rape, should seek medical attention immediately. Bougainville Crime in the autonomous province of Bougainville has declined over the last few years. However, acts of violence continue to occur in disputes. Dangers are high in the central mountains of Bougainville and in the south of the island due to the remoteness and the continued widespread possession of weapons. Review your travel plans and avoid non-essential travel to the highland provinces (Southern and Western Highlands, Hela and Enga provinces). This applies to a greater extent if you do not already have contacts/connections to organizations or institutions operating there, whose established connections to local communities can represent an important protective factor. Do not walk alone outside of guarded areas (e.g. hotels, restaurants), but only in groups and, if possible, accompanied by local people. Avoid walking and traveling overland in the dark. Even outside the highland provinces, always prefer transport from hotels or trustworthy tour operators and avoid using public transport and taxis. Always keep the windows and doors of a vehicle closed or locked. To reduce the risk of break-ins in accommodation, you can use additional security locks or chains on doors. Make sure windows are always tightly closed. Stay away from potential arguments. Do not resist armed robberies and give in to the perpetrators' demands without hesitation; this can reduce the risk of violent escalation. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary.

The disease is characterized by high fever and possibly prolonged joint and muscle pain. The symptoms often cannot be clearly distinguished from other mosquito-borne diseases. Chikungunya fever does not always heal without consequences; long-lasting rheumatism-like symptoms rarely occur. There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Transmission occurs through the bite of blood-sucking Anopheles mosquitoes that are active at dusk and at night. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica, in particular, is often fatal in non-immune people. The illness can break out weeks to months after your stay. If a fever occurs during this time, you should see a doctor quickly and point out that you are staying in an area with malaria. High risk in the province of Loreto (malaria tropica predominates here) and the northern regions of the province of Amazonas, northeastern parts of the province of San Martín. Low risk exists in the provinces above 2,500 m\xa0east of the Andes and in the urban area of \u200b\u200bIquitos. Minimal risk in the rest of the country above 2,500 m\xa0including\xa0the northern provinces in the west of the Andes (Tumbes, Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad and others). Lima, the provinces west of the Andes south of the Libertad province and the tourist highland areas (Cusco, Machu Picchu, Lake Titicaca) are malaria-free. See also the current distribution maps from the Standing Committee on Travel Medicine (StAR) of the DTG. The need for chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) depends on your travel profile. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adaptation as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical or travel doctor before taking them. It may be recommended to take a sufficient supply with you, see Malaria. Due to the mosquito-related infection risks, exposure prophylaxis is recommended for all travelers. Particular attention should be paid to the following points: Wearing light-colored clothing that covers the body (long pants, long shirts) Repeatedly applying insect repellent to all exposed parts of the body during the day (dengue!) as well as in the evening and at night (malaria!) Sleeping under an impregnated blanket if necessary mosquito net.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Most diarrheal diseases can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Since May 2019, more than 200 cases of neurological Guillan-Barre syndrome have also been reported in Lima, Junín, La Libertad (including Trujillo), Lambayeque (including Chiclayo) and Piura regions. The cause is probably due to a respiratory or food-borne pathogen. There is minimal risk for travelers. However, travelers in high-risk areas should observe food and drink precautions and hand hygiene measures. Some basic rules: Only drink water of safe origin, e.g. carbonated bottled water, never tap water. In an emergency, use filtered, disinfected and boiled water. Whenever possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth. When it comes to food: boil it or peel it yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always after bowel movements and always before preparing food and before eating. Carry out hand disinfection where appropriate and use disposable towels.', 'Leishmaniasis': 'Both skin/mucous membrane leishmaniasis and, rarely, organ leishmaniasis occur nationwide. The parasites are transmitted by small sand flies that are active at dusk and at night and prefer to stay in moist and shady habitats. In the case of insect bites that heal poorly or, for example, a persistent, unexplained fever, both diseases should be ruled out. To avoid leishmaniases, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially in the evening and at night, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Trypanosomiasis („Chagas disease“)': 'In rural areas, transmission of Chagas disease can occur in very simple accommodation. The risk for travelers is very low. Transmission occurs through predatory bugs whose infected feces get into the bite wound or, rarely, through the oral ingestion of contaminated fruit or sugar cane juices. In the acute phase of the disease, flu-like symptoms and up to 50% swelling of the eyelid occur. Years after the infection, serious organ changes can occur. Protect yourself from nocturnal predatory bug bites in simple accommodation in the countryside through exposure prophylaxis, particularly through correctly installed bed nets.', 'Oropouche-Fieber': 'The Oropouche virus causes a disease similar to dengue (see above) and is also transmitted by mosquitoes.', 'Poliomyelitis': 'In 2023, a case of poliomyelitis (polio) caused by mutated VDPV1 vaccine viruses occurred in Peru. Control measures were initiated by the state authorities. Despite the poliomyelitis case, the WHO has not yet classified Peru as a country in which cVDPV1 is circulating and which poses a potential risk of international spread (category 1). This would happen if polio viruses were detected in wastewater or further cases of polio, see poliomyelitis (polio). Currently, no proof of vaccination is required when leaving the country in accordance with WHO requirements. Ensure full vaccination against poliomyelitis (poliomyelitis) and a booster every ten years.', 'Leptospirosis': 'All year round, leptospirosis can occasionally be transmitted through skin injuries caused by water contaminated with rodent excrement. This bacterial infection usually progresses like a mild flu-like infection, but in rare cases it can also lead to serious liver and kidney involvement. If exposure is expected, drug prophylaxis with doxycycline can be considered in individual cases after careful risk assessment by a travel or tropical medicine specialist, see also Leptospirosis.', 'Altitude sickness (“Soroche”)': 'At altitudes above 2,500 m, a more common and occasionally life-threatening illness (see altitude sickness) caused by climbing too quickly, which usually only becomes apparent after 24 hours or longer at altitude. Warning symptoms can include sleep disorders, headaches, dizziness, vomiting and increasing shortness of breath. If the symptoms do not disappear after a break or an overnight stay, you should descend below an altitude of 2,000 meters. All ages and often tourists traveling by plane to Cusco or Puno are affected, not just mountaineers. Mate de coca has no certain preventive effect. The medications used to combat altitude sickness require a prescription.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is a fundamental risk of a life-threatening HIV infection through unprotected sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes and cannulas) and blood transfusions. Condom use is always recommended, especially on the occasion of acquaintances. Always use condoms.', 'Medical care': 'Medical care in Lima is available in the private sector, for example. T. to an internationally high standard. However, the public sector is limited in terms of personnel, equipment, logistics and e.g. T. hygienic resources are usually structured in a deficit, especially in rural regions. As a rule, the treatment options in Cusco are not sufficient to adequately care for serious emergencies. As soon as medical conditions permit, seriously ill or injured people should be transferred to Lima. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG.

To date, there have been an increasing number of bomb attacks in western Mindanao, killing numerous people and injuring an even greater number of people. The attack targets were in Midsayap, Cotabato City, Isulan, General Santos City and Datu Saudi Ampatuan in Mindanao; in Lamitan City on Basilan and on Jolo and Indanan in Sulu. The Islamist terrorist group Abu Sayyaf, which operates in the region, is responsible for kidnappings and murders, particularly in Mindanao and the Sulu Sea, and targets foreign kidnap victims. A German hostage was murdered in 2016, her traveling companion in 2017 and most recently a Dutch citizen in 2019 and an Indonesian citizen in 2020. Foreigners who know the area are also at risk.

The “war on drugs” is being waged in a weaker form under the current government with a new approach. However, there is still the risk of being “in the wrong place at the wrong time” and getting into exchanges of fire.

This also affects car traffic, e.g. vehicles waiting at traffic lights. Kidnappings, particularly of business people, and other methods of extortion to obtain ransom and protection money are common. In some cases, security staff also place prohibited items in travelers' luggage in order to extort money under the threat of fines and the police being called in for allegedly committing administrative offenses. In some cases, tourists are asked to transport items and luggage, especially on domestic but also international flights. These can involve drugs, the discovery of which usually has serious consequences for tourists (see legal details). In entertainment districts, drugs or knockout drops are used in food and drink in order to commit a robbery or get a higher bill. This can also happen with taxis stopped on the street as well as tourist guides. Credit card fraud and scams when exchanging money, but also by telephone and email, are also widespread. Internet fraud is often committed from the Philippines. It is not uncommon for people to initially initiate personal fictitious relationships on the Internet in order to then borrow money that is never paid back. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe. Prefer cashless payments, do not leave your cards out of sight and only take the cash you need for the day and no valuables. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports, bus stations, on buses and pay attention to your valuables. When traveling in a private car or taxi in the city, keep the doors and windows closed. If possible, only use official taxis or hotel taxis, make sure you use the taximeter or agree on the fare before you start your journey. Do not accept offers from strangers for tourist tours and refuse to take luggage with you. Never leave food and drinks unattended and do not accept them from strangers.

Most recently, super typhoon Egay/Doksuri hit the Philippines in July 2023, where it claimed several lives and caused significant damage. Infrastructure is regularly severely damaged and roads and bridges can become impassable. Earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis The Philippines is located in a very seismically active zone, the Ring of Fire, so that earthquakes, seaquakes, volcanic activities and tsunamis can occur at any time. Stronger earthquakes regularly cause significant damage and cause fatalities. Of the numerous volcanoes, 53 are active. The highest is Mount Apo, which is almost 3,000 meters high; The most active fire mountain is Mayon and the most dangerous is Pinatubo. The Taal is considered a supervolcano. Danger levels and exclusion zones often apply. Volcanic eruptions and ashfall affecting air traffic are possible at any time. Pay attention to weather forecasts and especially typhoon warnings such as those from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center or the Philippine Weather Service ""Pagasa"". If there is a storm warning, pay attention to the information about cyclones abroad or the information from the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Relief.

Swimming accidents happen all the time. Tropical storms form from May to November, particularly over the Azores. This is hurricane season in the North Atlantic. Storms, heavy rain and extreme weather changes can occur in Madeira all year round. Natural forces such as landslides, sinkholes, ocean currents and surf are often underestimated. Tourists often have accidents, sometimes fatally, especially when leaving the marked hiking trails, for example at the Levada do Norte. Be sure to observe the flag warnings about swimming safety and follow the instructions of the lifeguards. Pay attention to trail markings and do not leave marked hiking trails. Follow weather reports regularly and pay attention to storm warnings from the National Hurricane Center. In the event of a storm warning, please note the information on hurricanes abroad or the information from the Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance.

In roundabouts, vehicles in the roundabout generally have the right of way. On multi-lane roundabouts, the outermost right lane may only be used to use the next exit. The alcohol limit is 0.5, for novice drivers in the first two years and professional drivers 0.2. Yellow markings on the edge of the road mean there is an absolute parking ban; failure to do so could result in a vehicle being towed away. Fines often have to be paid directly on site. Parking in inner city areas is usually subject to a fee. Failure to do so could result in towing or being immobilized (wheel claw). Drive attentively and carefully. Strictly adhere to the traffic and speed regulations (maximum permitted speed on motorways: 120 km/h and on country roads: 100 km/h), particularly on inter-city roads due to the increased frequency of accidents. Toll Most motorways are subject to tolls and the toll fees are comparatively high. There are several different operating companies (e.g. Brisa, Ascendi).

This further restricts the work of foreign journalists and media professionals. Both private and business critical statements about current political developments on all social media can be associated with unpredictable personal risks. Extreme restraint is advised.

If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is a general risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. However, HIV infections are very rare in Saudi Arabia. Always use condoms, especially with casual acquaintances.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome)': 'Since 2012, this infectious disease has been causing isolated, severe respiratory illnesses, primarily in countries on the Arabian Peninsula. The cause is a coronavirus (MERS-CoV), whose biology has not been conclusively clarified. Camels appear to be involved in transmission to humans. Transmission from person to person only occurred through very close contact with sick people, see MERS. To prevent illness, avoid unnecessary contact with camels.', 'Other infectious diseases': 'There are several other infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, but these are generally rare among travelers (e.g. leishmaniasis, phlebotomus fever, filariasis, Rift Valley fever). To avoid infectious diseases transmitted by mosquitoes or ticks, protect yourself from insects as part of exposure prophylaxis. The bacterial infectious disease brucellosis can be transmitted through consumption of unpasteurized dairy products. Avoid consuming unpasteurized dairy products. The worm disease schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is endemic in some oases, including around Riyadh, see Schistosomiasis. To protect yourself from schistosomiasis, avoid contact with fresh water in oases.', 'Air pollution': 'Particularly in larger cities such as Riyadh, Jeddah and Yanbu, there is now pollution from fine dust and sand turbulence. Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual.', 'Medical care': 'Medical care is good in Riyadh, Jeddah and Mecca. In other parts of the country, including larger cities, the level is not always reliably assured. Only private health facilities are freely accessible to foreigners. The state healthcare system can usually only be used in real emergency situations and for initial treatment. Take an individual first-aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures on the go, see first-aid kit. Take out foreign travel health insurance for the duration of your stay abroad that covers risks that are not covered by statutory health insurance (e.g. necessary return transport to Germany in the event of illness, treatment with private doctors or in private clinics). Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG.

In winter, drops in temperature and extreme cold in the north as well as snowstorms and freezing rain are commonplace. Sufficient safety precautions (maps, life jackets, cell phone, leashes, drinking water, provisions, first aid kit, etc.) should definitely be taken when excursions on the numerous lakes and on the coast, also due to the low water temperatures. In the north of the country and in winter, activities require particularly good preparation and equipment. Always keep yourself informed about the weather conditions. Pay attention to relevant news and weather reports in the media. Avoid areas affected by fires. Take the climatic conditions into account and plan activities accordingly. Be sure to heed warnings about currents or thin ice. During darker seasons outside of cities, wear yellow high-visibility vests when walking and cycling, as is common practice in Sweden. Follow advice and, if necessary, instructions from local authorities such as Krisinformation.'}","{'border controls': 'Sweden has temporarily introduced random checks at all border crossing points. Cases are increasing, especially at the rest areas in front of the Öresund Bridge in Denmark, where hitchhikers ask to be taken to Sweden for a fee or free of charge. During border controls on the Swedish side of the bridge, German drivers must expect to be arrested and charged with people smuggling if it turns out that the people they take do not have a valid travel document or a valid Schengen residence permit. The same applies in the case of drug smuggling. Always carry a valid travel document with you. Do not take unknown people or foreign goods across the Danish-Swedish border.', 'Infrastructure/transport': ""There are well-developed bus and train connections, particularly high-speed trains between major cities, as well as a good network of public transport such as a subway in Stockholm.

Notice boards and counters at main train stations, but not at smaller stations or on buses, provide information about fare systems. There is very limited parking space available in city centers. In Sweden you have to drive with low beam or daytime running lights all year round, even during the day. A limit of 0.2 per mille applies in road and ship traffic. Anyone who “can no longer safely drive a vehicle” under the influence of alcohol or drugs can also be convicted of drunkenness. There are high penalties for violations (including prison sentences of up to two years). There are no tolerance limits for speeding. Penalties are significantly higher than in Germany. The applicable parking rules must be observed. Illegal parking results in high fines or fees (for private parking space owners). Due to street cleaning, many parking spaces are subject to time restrictions, as can be seen from the days and times. Parking spaces in the same area are often assigned to different machines. At some machines, payment is only possible with Swedish bonus cards or credit cards. Alternatively, parking tickets can often be purchased via parking apps. The Swedish Transport Authority provides information on parking lot signage. The use of cell phones while driving is prohibited. There is a risk of high fines. The use of other communication devices while driving is also prohibited if it has a negative impact on driving the vehicle. Stockholm and Gothenburg have a city center toll, passages are automatically read and registered. The same applies to the bridge toll in Motala and Sundsvall.

However, pocket knives are generally tolerated. Prostitution is a criminal offense in Sweden. Suitors face fines or prison sentences of up to one year. Possession and consumption of drugs - even in small quantities for personal consumption - are prohibited in Sweden (imprisonment of up to three years, in serious cases significantly longer sentences are possible). Alcohol consumption is prohibited in many public places. The right of determination lies with the respective municipality and is regulated inconsistently. To avoid trouble, it is generally not recommended to drink alcohol in public. There are severe penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol at levels as low as 0.1 mg/l in the breath or 0.2 per mille in the blood (fines and prison sentences of up to two years in serious cases, as well as driving license revocation). This also applies to steering boats/watercraft. When arrested in Sweden, pre-trial detainees - and also their public defenders - are sometimes subject to strict restrictions during pre-trial detention, such as: B. Blocking contact with people outside the prison. It is therefore sometimes very difficult for relatives to obtain information about a pre-trial detainee while the police investigation is ongoing.

The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches. In rare cases, serious complications, including possible death, occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see dengue fever. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.

The disease is characterized by high fever and possibly prolonged joint and muscle pain. The symptoms often cannot be clearly distinguished from other mosquito-borne diseases. Chikungunya fever does not always heal without consequences; long-lasting rheumatism-like symptoms rarely occur. There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. Malaria is one of the most serious diseases in Senegal in terms of both morbidity and mortality. Malaria is one of the most serious diseases in Senegal in terms of both morbidity and mortality. In the southern two thirds of the country including the province of Diourbel and the city of Touba, the region around the city of Sebicotane in the province of Dakar and in the parts of the country south of Gambia, the risk of malaria is high all year round. In the northern third of the country, in the coastal region north of Gambia including the Delta du Saloum National Park, there is a medium risk from January to May and a high risk from June to December. The proportion of malaria tropica (P. falciparum) is over 99%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them.

Always use condoms.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Meningococcal disease': 'During the dry season (December–April), meningitis epidemics occur regularly in the countries of the “African meningitis belt”. Pneumococci and meningococci are predominantly identified as pathogens. A tetravalent meningococcal vaccination may be useful in cases of particular exposure or long-term stay. Pneumococcal vaccination is not recommended as a travel vaccination because the circulating serotypes in West Africa are not known and the available vaccines only cover a few serotypes.', 'rabies': 'Rabies is a fatal infectious disease caused by viruses that are transmitted in the saliva of infected animals or people. There is a high risk of bite injuries from stray dogs and monkeys nationwide, see rabies. Avoid contact with animals. Get advice about a rabies vaccination and get vaccinated.

Therapy is primarily symptomatic; The virus-inhibiting drug ribavirin is said to have a positive effect. There is no vaccination. The risk for tourists is extremely low. Make sure you protect yourself from tick bites (clothing that covers your body, sturdy shoes). Be careful when handling raw meat and around people who are sick.', 'Medical care': 'Medical care in the interior of the country cannot be compared to Europe and is often problematic in terms of technology, equipment and/or hygiene. Dakar, on the other hand, is still one of the two medical reference centers for West Africa. French-speaking specialists in almost all disciplines are available. Plannable operations should be carried out in Germany. In the event of an emergency, various clinics in Dakar can be considered. It is not necessary to bring medication with you other than a medicine cabinet, which is also common in Germany, unless individuals are dependent on special medication or large cities are not being visited. The pharmacies in Dakar have a good range of all important standard medicines, often of French origin. However, counterfeit medications with unsafe content cannot be ruled out. Local hospitals and doctors are increasingly requiring tourists to pay in advance. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad.

Violations of traffic regulations are punished with severe penalties depending on the severity of the culpable behavior. When traveling in or through Serbia, tolls must be paid on motorways and motorway-like roads. Switching to country roads to avoid paying the toll is associated with much longer travel times and often poor road conditions (potholes, missing edge markings). The toll in Serbia can be paid with cash or credit card. Small notes and coins should be carried with you to pay the toll in EUR or to exchange money at the borders. Automatic speed monitoring takes place on all motorway sections in Serbia, each of which has a minimum travel time corresponding to the maximum permissible speed. Failure to do so will result in a high fine (depending on the extent of the violation). Anyone driving with foreign license plates can usually pay the fine immediately to the police stationed at the toll station. In the case of other traffic offenses or traffic offenses identified by the police, the driver must be accompanied by the police to the relevant court. Any fine imposed there must be paid into a bank or post office. In particular, accidents resulting in personal injury or death are punishable by imprisonment for several years. The sentence imposed is usually not suspended. If the driver of the vehicle is not the same as the owner registered in the vehicle documents, a power of attorney with a publicly certified signature of the owner in Serbian or, alternatively, English, must be carried, which also contains the personal details and passport number of the authorized person. The German license plate is sufficient as proof of valid motor vehicle liability insurance. However, it is recommended that you take your Green Insurance Card with you. In the event of any accident in Serbia, the police must be called and they will draw up a damage report, which is essential for insurance purposes and, if necessary, customs procedures when leaving the country.

Military conflicts also take place on a smaller scale in the southern federal states of South West State and Jubaland. The military operations of the Somali armed forces are to be intensified. In return, al-Shabaab increasingly carried out devastating attacks in regional capitals and in Mogadishu. In the worst attack since 2017, over 100 people were killed in October 2022 near the Ministry of Education in Mogadishu by the successive explosion of two explosive devices and over 300 people were injured. In November 2022, an attack on the “Villa Rose” hotel claimed 10 lives and injured numerous people. On February 1, 2023, the secured area of \u200b\u200bthe international airport was attacked with mortars, and several African Union (ATMIS) soldiers were injured, some seriously. Further attacks of comparable dimensions in response to the government's current military offensive against al-Shabaab cannot be ruled out. In “Somaliland”, there have been military clashes since February 2023, particularly in the Sool and Sanaag region around the city of Las Anod, which have flared up again and again and have already led to numerous deaths and over hundreds of thousands of displaced people. Terrorist-motivated kidnappings, including in the waters off Somalia, occur again and again. Illegal checkpoints are repeatedly set up by the military, militias and terrorists on all overland roads. If you have to travel to Somalia despite the travel warning for stays that are unavoidable for work, be aware of the considerable risk and ensure that you have a carefully and professionally developed security concept. German citizens who are currently in Somalia despite the existing travel warning are advised to leave the country quickly unless they are subject to a reliable evacuation regime, e.g. as part of a UN mission. Always be alert and careful, especially in busy places and on special occasions. Please note the global safety notice."", 'Domestic political situation': 'In addition to attacks, there are repeated armed clashes in Somalia and the capital Mogadishu. In addition to the high risk of becoming a victim of terrorism, there is a significant risk from combat operations and criminally motivated acts of violence. In the event of an emergency (health-related, crime-related or war-related), there are largely no functioning government agencies that could provide assistance. Consular assistance cannot be provided on site. Staying in Somalia is generally very dangerous, but especially in the capital region of Banadir and the states of Jubbaland, Southwest, Hirshabelle and Galmudug as well as in parts of Puntland and the east of “Somaliland”. There are indications that foreign professionals and travelers in particular are at risk of becoming victims of assassinations, attacks, kidnappings and other terrorist-motivated violent crimes. Militias and other security forces outside the Somali federal government often have unpredictable loyalties and typically cannot guarantee security for foreign travelers. Demonstrations are taking place more frequently and can lead to violent clashes at any time. This can also lead to road blockages. There is a risk of landmines throughout the country. If you have to travel to Somalia for work-related stays despite the travel warning, be aware of the considerable risk and ensure that you have a carefully and professionally developed security concept. German nationals who are currently in Somalia despite the existing travel warning are advised to leave the country quickly unless they are subject to a reliable evacuation regime, e.g. as part of a UN mission. Stay only in United Nations Security Department-approved accommodation nationwide. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people.

In parts of southern and central Somalia, fighting is taking place between Somali security forces/militia and the militant Islamist group al-Shabaab, in which forces of the African Union (ATMIS) are also involved. There are also repeated clashes between Somali militias. The Somali government and ATMIS cannot guarantee protection against general or terrorist crime in the country. Especially in the capital Mogadishu, there are frequent clashes between the Somali security forces, which often result in harm to uninvolved people. Do not travel overland in southern and central Somalia. In the Mudug region (border between Puntland and the interim administration of the Galmudug state), in the areas disputed between Puntland and “Somaliland” (Sool and Sanaag regions and in the eastern part of the Togdheer region) and in parts of the Bari region (Bossaso, Galghala- Mountains), in Gedo (Jubaland), Hiran (Galmudug) and around Guri Ceel (Glamudug), in addition to attacks, fighting must be expected. Outside the Sool and Sanaag region, the security forces in “Somaliland” can provide a significantly higher level of security with regard to terrorist activities and general crime in a comparatively pacified environment than in other parts of the country. This is particularly true for the western areas (Awdal and Wooqoyi Galbeed regions with the cities of Hargeisa and Berbera). However, dangers resulting from the general threat of terrorism in Somalia cannot be completely ruled out for “Somaliland”. Due to official requirements, overland journeys in Puntland and “Somaliland” must be accompanied by special units of the respective security forces. Prior coordination with the security representatives of the United Nations or the European Union is essential. Coordinate overland journeys in Puntland and “Somaliland” with the security representatives of the United Nations and the European Union and only carry them out in a convoy and with the accompaniment of the special units of the respective security forces. Avoid large crowds of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces.', 'crime': 'There is a significant risk of kidnapping across the country, including to a lesser extent in “Somaliland”. Several Western foreigners have been kidnapped in the past. Acts of violence by armed groups and gangs and poverty-related crime are widespread throughout the country. Armed robberies, carjackings, sexual abuse and even murders occur frequently. If you have to travel to Somalia for work-related stays despite the travel warning, be aware of the considerable risk and ensure that you have a carefully and professionally developed security concept.', 'Piracy on the high seas': ""There is still a risk of pirate attacks and hijackings off the coast. Ships off Somalia are still at risk of being attacked and hijacked. Despite international efforts to curb piracy, pirate attacks can still occur; effective protection cannot be guaranteed. The European Union's naval operation ATALANTA operates in a wide area of \u200b\u200boperations off the coasts of Somalia and neighboring countries outside Somali territorial waters. The aim is to deter, prevent and combat acts of piracy and armed robbery. Slow ships with low sides are generally more at risk of pirate attacks than fast ships with high sides. Registration with the Maritime Security Center and the presence of warships do not guarantee that ships will not be attacked, shot at or hijacked by pirates. If your trip is absolutely necessary despite the travel warning, find out about the current piracy situation at the IMB Piracy Reporting Center. As a skipper, be particularly careful in endangered waters and be sure to register with the Maritime Security Center.""}","{'General information': 'The climate is tropical semi-arid and therefore usually very hot and dry.

If the supply situation, see travel information – supply situation, deteriorates again, a resurgence of nationwide protests cannot be ruled out. In such protests, violent riots cannot be ruled out (as in spring 2022). There are also recurring conflicts between followers of the Buddhist majority and other religious communities. However, no violent riots have been recorded in the last few months. Find out about local media. Avoid demonstrations, political rallies and large gatherings of people. Follow instructions from security guards.', 'crime': ""Violent crime occurs most often within local societies. Foreigners, especially women traveling alone or in small groups, are occasionally affected by violent, including sexual, attacks, including in tourist centers. Drugs or knockout drops are sometimes administered through drinks. There are break-ins in hotels and “guesthouses”. Visitors should be wary of attempted fraud, especially when purchasing high-priced goods (e.g. gemstones/jewelry). Sri Lanka Police records complaints of sexual assault on 24-hour telephone number 1938. Sri Lanka has dedicated tourist police stations in the main tourist areas along the southwest coast where reports can be lodged. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at train stations or on buses and pay attention to your valuables. Use caution when offering drinks/food to strangers and do not leave them unattended in a restaurant or bar. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Protect your data and contact the police if necessary.""}","{'General information': 'There is a tropical, humid, hot monsoon climate. Monsoon-like rains can cause brief but severe flooding in Sri Lanka. Basically, the rainy season extends from December to March in the northeast and from June to October in the southwest. However, it is becoming increasingly difficult to clearly define the time (climate change); prolonged, heavy rainfall and flooding can occur in all regions and throughout the year. Sri Lanka is located in a seismically active zone, so earthquakes and tsunamis can occur. Follow news and weather reports. In the event of a storm warning, please note the information on hurricanes abroad. Familiarize yourself with what to do during earthquakes and tsunamis. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences. Always observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities.'}","{'Supply situation': 'Sri Lanka remains in an economic crisis. In the meantime, there were supply bottlenecks for essential goods such as fuel, food and medicine. The supply situation has improved for several months, although there can always be shortages, especially of medication, see the sections Security - Domestic Political Situation and Health - Medical Care. The import restrictions have been lifted. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that functioning supply chains cannot be restored in a timely manner. Electricity is still rationed, meaning there may be extended power outages across the country. However, the government has ordered the state-owned power company to refrain from power cuts in areas frequented by tourists.', 'Infrastructure/transport': 'For cross-country travel, rail is preferable to public buses, which are often involved in serious accidents due to reckless driving. There is left-hand traffic. For reasons of road safety, driving at night outside of cities is not advisable. Tourist infrastructure is now available in all parts of the country. However, traveling to the north and east of the country can sometimes be difficult and time-consuming. Areas with an increased mine risk (from the period of the civil war 1983-2009) are marked as such and entry must be avoided at all costs. There has been an increased military presence, particularly in the Northern Province, since the end of the civil war.', ""Driver's license"": 'The international driving license is required and is only valid in conjunction with the national German driving license. For the international driving license, the holder must submit an application to the Automobile Association of Ceylon for a so-called “recognition permit” as recognition of the German driving license.

It is forbidden to be photographed with your back to a Buddha statue. Disrespectful photos of religious subjects can result in severe fines and even imprisonment. Taking photos of the so-called “Cloud Girl Frescoes” on Sigiriya Rock is prohibited. Violation of this ban could result in heavy fines and confiscation of the camera by the Sri Lankan police authorities. Taking photos of military facilities is also prohibited. Temples may only be entered with shoulders covered and pants or skirts that reach below the knees. Approach religious sites, objects and symbols with restraint and respect and dress appropriately when visiting Buddhist temples. Do not display clothing or tattoos with Buddhist motifs as they may be perceived as denigrating Buddhism. Make sure you are allowed to take photographs or ask for permission. Be sure to follow the instructions and regulations at Sri Lankan cultural sites.', 'LGBTIQ': 'Both male and female homosexuality are punishable in Sri Lanka. In practice, however, criminal proceedings almost never arise in cases of homosexuality among adults. Please note the general LGBTIQ travel advice.', 'Legal specifics': 'Sri Lankan law, especially criminal law, must also be fully observed by foreign tourists. Reference is made to the provisions on foreign currency imports and exports, illegal possession of drugs and weapons, and sexual offenses. Violations as well as behavior that can be interpreted as religious disrespect can result in very harsh [SA(p1]\xa0 penalties. Sexual abuse of children (§ 176 StGB) can also be punished in Germany, even if the act was committed abroad. Particular caution is required when purchasing property. There are always cases in which tourists purchase properties in the name of a Sri Lankan partner in order to avoid the high taxes that foreigners have to pay when purchasing property. Here You should definitely not get involved. In Sri Lanka, as in Germany, the person registered in the land register is the sole owner of both the land and all buildings built on it, regardless of who financed the purchase or construction. Consult Always consult a lawyer before purchasing and pay attention to the entry in the Sri Lankan land registers.', 'Money/credit cards': ""The local currency is the Sri Lanka Rupee (LKR). Withdrawing cash from ATMs and paying with credit cards are common, but for more remote regions and smaller shops it is advisable to take cash with you. Cash may only be exchanged at authorized locations (e.g. airport), banks and hotels that confirm the change on a form. Cases of credit card fraud also occur in Sri Lanka. It is therefore always advisable to check whether smaller bills can be paid in cash. Before treatment in a hospital or doctor's office, you are often required to present a credit card, even if you have valid international health insurance. The credit card should therefore always be carried with you. Foreign bank cards cannot be used in Sri Lanka.""}","{'General information': 'Entry and customs regulations for German citizens can change at short notice without the Foreign Office being informed in advance.

Handbags are often snatched on the streets, especially in city centers. Thefts also occur in hotel restaurants and rooms. At ATMs there are always cases of manipulation or attempted fraud by people who pretend to want to help you withdraw money, but are actually aiming to exchange the bank/credit card for a counterfeit or to obtain the PIN by fraud. Other scams and credit card abuse are also common. Travelers or tour groups are stopped and robbed on highways or access roads, for example by: B. be wedged or occasionally stopped by vehicles that falsely pose as police. The routes to and from the airports in Johannesburg and Pretoria are particularly affected by this. In heavy traffic and at red lights, lightning break-ins, so-called “smash-and-grab” robberies, occur more frequently, in which car doors are opened or windows are broken in order to steal valuables from the car.

Avoid the city centers of Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria, Durban, Port Elizabeth and other large cities after hours and especially after dark; On Sundays and public holidays you should only stay in the city centers in groups. Also exercise caution during the day. In the event of an attack, refrain from resisting and cooperate; the perpetrators could be armed and use stabbing or firearms without hesitation. Always keep car windows closed and car doors locked from the inside. Be sure to avoid hitchhiking or picking up hitchhikers. Never leave handbags, cameras, cell phones, etc. visible in the car; instead, transport them in the locked trunk. When waiting at large intersections, pay close attention to your surroundings and keep a sufficient distance from other vehicles. It is best to only go on excursions in groups. If you are traveling alone, try to join larger travel groups if possible. When going on trips to publicly accessible natural areas and parks and to well-known sights, do not use isolated streets or hiking trails and avoid deserted areas. Only undertake township visits in an organized manner and only with a local guide. As a backpacker, make sure you have safe accommodations. Relevant travel guides provide recommendations for backpacker hostels; Nevertheless, caution is advised.

There is a domestic flight network and bus services between all major cities, but few train services. A rental car is recommended for individual travelers and small groups, as the public transport networks are uncertain and confusing. An exception is the “Gautrain” between Johannesburg and Pretoria. In South Africa, traffic drives on the left. The road network is dense and intercity roads are mostly in good condition. Tolls are often required on motorways. Secondary roads, especially in rural areas, are often inadequately secured and of poor quality. Dangers arise from the inconsideration of other road users, especially shared taxis, and frequent overtaking on the left despite a ban. Some traffic signs have a different meaning than in Germany. For example, a green turn arrow at the traffic light does not mean that you do not have to pay attention to pedestrians or oncoming traffic. In South Africa there are many “4-way stop” intersections, which means that all cars must initially stop at the intersection; The journey then continues according to the order of arrival, i.e. the car that stopped first at the intersection is the first to leave. There are many speed cameras and violations can result in heavy fines. The alcohol limit is 0.5. If this limit is exceeded, arrest and imprisonment must be expected. Avoid suburban trains in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Durban (except Gautrain). If you do use the trains, we recommend traveling in first class and only during peak hours of the day. Order taxis only from reliable, well-known companies; Guesthouses and hotels can often help you make reservations. Don't hail taxis on the street. Avoid hitchhiking and taking so-called minibus taxis. If you are stopped by the police and asked to pay a fine in cash on the spot, this is not legal. In such cases, call the South African fraud and anti-corruption hotline on 0800 00 28 70. Drive extremely defensively; Avoid any altercations with other road users. Do not insist on your rights or let others know verbally or through gestures if you do not agree with the driving behavior of other road users.

If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a high risk of malaria from October to May and a medium risk from June to September in the north-east and east of Mpumalanga Province (including the entire Kruger Park and neighboring national parks) and in the north and north-east of Limpopo Province. A low risk exists all year round in the rest of the north, in the northeast up to the Tugela River, in KwaZulu-Natal (including Tembe-Elephant, Ndumo Game Reserve, iSimangaliso Wetland, Hluhluwe, iMfoolozi), in the northwest of the southeastern part of Limpopo Province, the Waterberg -Region including Marakele and Madikwe National Parks. The proportion of malaria tropica (P. falciparum) is over 99%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, especially in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications are available for this (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine). Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'The biggest health problem in South Africa is HIV/AIDS with a very high incidence. Up to 20% of the adult population (regional differences) are infected with HIV. A co-infection with tuberculosis caused by immunodeficiency is the cause of the high mortality, with germs that are multi-resistant to tuberculosis drugs being largely responsible. There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. The risk of tuberculosis infection via droplet infection only exists in appropriate medical facilities or when people with tuberculosis suffer from long stays in cramped living spaces.

Violent clashes across the country are leading to supply shortages and restricted movement. The prices of basic foodstuffs, electricity and transport have risen significantly. Access to cash is severely limited. Borders with neighboring countries have reportedly been closed or are often subject to access restrictions by security forces. There is a risk of landmines off the main traffic route on the way from Khartoum to Egypt, in the Kordofans and Blue Nile. Darfur Region In the five Darfur states (Central Darfur, East Darfur, North Darfur, West Darfur and South Darfur) in the west of Sudan, there are isolated cases of violent clashes and banditry. Some of them are also affected by the armed conflict between the Sudanese military and the RSF. There is also a very high risk of kidnapping. Travel to Darfur always requires prior approval from the Sudanese government. South Kordofan (including Abyei), Unity State and Blue Nile Military hostilities may occur in the South Kordofan and Blue Nile regions. In the city of Abyei and the border region of the same name between Sudan and South Sudan - the border between the two countries is disputed - the situation can change very quickly depending on local and regional events. Fighting between the army and rebels also occurs again and again in rural areas in South Kordofan and the Blue Nile, especially in the Nuba Mountains. Northern Sudan In northern Sudan, particularly in the Meroe and Karima pyramid region, the security situation is unclear due to violent armed clashes between the Sudanese military and the RSF. Fighting may occur. Eastern Sudan Violent clashes can occur between different population groups and between the army and RSF. A blockade of the road between Port Sudan and Khartoum is possible at any time. Please note the current travel warning and departure notice for Sudan. If you are currently in Sudan, always carefully consider the risk of moving from your current location, as fighting may continue to occur in many locations. Do not try to cross borders illegally.

Tourists also need a travel permit to travel outside of Khartoum if they intend to travel to conflict regions, see also the domestic political situation. The risk of accidents when driving overland should not be underestimated due to poor roads, lack of markings and the often risky driving style. Night driving should be avoided entirely. A defensive driving style is strongly recommended. Medical help in the event of an accident is generally not available. Due to the after-effects of the civil war in South Sudan, the tribal conflicts and the still tense situation in some parts of the south, west and east of the country, it is not safe to cross Sudan in either a north-south or east-west direction. When attempting to cross borders illegally, there is a risk of unmarked or inadequately marked minefields and long-term imprisonment.

These include well-known sights, government and administrative buildings, foreign embassies, business and tourism centers, hotels, markets, religious meeting places and generally larger gatherings of people. In the past there have been attacks on both the mainland and Zanzibar. Places of worship and religious leaders were attacked. The background often remained unclear. In connection with the 2020 presidential elections, terrorist attacks were recently carried out in the south of the Mtwara region, near the border with Cabo Delgado province in Mozambique; the situation at the border remains volatile. Further attacks cannot be ruled out. In view of the deteriorated security situation, exercise particular caution, especially in crowded places, international hotels, establishments with international visitors, foreign embassies, known meeting places of foreigners and during unforeseen, unusual events.

In addition to petty crimes such as pickpocketing and robberies, there is an increasing number of kidnappings with extortion of money, in which foreigners in particular are approached by supposedly helpful passers-by or alleged taxi drivers and offered support such as rides in order to then rob them and/or force them to withdraw cash from ATMs under the threat of violence . In particular, we warn against traveling with minibuses and taxi drivers who are not known or taxi rides arranged through acquaintances. Cycling and walking should be avoided after dark. The Foreign Office is aware of several cases in which foreigners were forced to obtain money transfers by calling family or acquaintances. This type of crime is increasing significantly throughout the country and especially in the tourist hotspots (Arusha, Zanzibar, Dar es Salaam and Morogoro). Preferred locations are the train station, ferry dock and bus stations, but also increasingly residential areas, such as Oyster Bay and Masaki. When vehicles are attacked, valuables are attempted to be stolen through open windows and unlocked car doors. Unguarded beaches and isolated areas, as well as beaches in coastal towns, are particularly dangerous. There are also an increasing number of cases in which bags or backpacks are violently snatched from pedestrians by thieves on passing motorcycles or from cars, often with considerable risk to life and limb. Only get into registered taxis (recognizable by white license plates and a green, yellow or blue vertical stripe on the white body) whose drivers are known to you personally, were referred by people you know or whose journeys can be traced (e.g. via Uber) . Even if you have booked a taxi driver, for example through a hotel, you should be careful: drivers of registered taxis pick up their passengers within the airport terminal. Do not get into a taxi outside the airport premises, including at the taxi stand in front of Terminal 2. Avoid cross-country journeys, bicycle rides and walks after dark. When traveling in rental cars, keep windows and doors closed and locked; Always observe your surroundings carefully. When staying overnight, especially at campsites and in remote areas, pay attention to the safety precautions in place. If you are a tourist in the Kilimanjaro region, exercise particular caution and follow the instructions of the mountain guides. Avoid unguarded beaches and secluded areas, but also beaches within coastal towns, even during the day. Do not resist an attack. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Be particularly careful in large crowds such as at airports, train stations and on buses, but also when withdrawing money.

Tourists, for example, are specifically led into shops and put under pressure to buy counterfeits or inferior products. In remote areas and in the border areas In Cambodia and Myanmar, attacks by armed gangs can occur. Security precautions in hotels and clubs in Thailand sometimes do not meet European standards. Only use taxis or tuk-tuks whose drivers have spoken to you yourself. Prepare trekking tours well and it is best to undertake them in a tour group under expert guidance. Pay attention to safety and rescue facilities on ferries and excursion boats and exercise caution accordingly. In cases of possible blackmail with the help of corrupt police officers, contact the German embassy in Bangkok immediately. Do not give your passport as a deposit when renting vehicles. Keep money, ID cards, driver\'s licenses and other important documents safe and save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Be vigilant and look after your valuables in large crowds such as airports, train stations, buses and beaches. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check in person or contact the police.'}","{'General information': 'The climate is tropical. Large-scale floods and landslides often occur, particularly in the rainy season from May to October, which often kill people. In the southeast of the Thai peninsula (including Koh Samui), heavy rain and isolated tropical storms also occur from November to January. Thailand is in a seismically active zone where earthquakes and seaquakes are to be expected. Always pay attention to warnings from the Thai Meteorological Department. Observe prohibitions, signs and warnings as well as the instructions of local authorities. In the event of a storm warning, please note the information on hurricanes abroad. Familiarize yourself with what to do during earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': 'There is a domestic air network, railways, bus services and, in Bangkok, a rapid transit system. There is left-hand traffic; Particular caution is required in road traffic. In Thailand the number of fatal traffic accidents is very high, 70% of the victims are two-wheeler riders. Helmets are required for motorcyclists. After traffic accidents, impulsive reactions from those involved (even armed violence) cannot be ruled out. In the urban area of \u200b\u200bBangkok, taxis with the inscription “Taxi Meter” are generally only billed using a meter. Taxi meters are not always available outside of Bangkok. In Phuket, taxis from the eastern part of the island are not allowed to drive to the western part (to the beaches). Tuk-tuks, on the other hand, can move freely across the entire island. During tuk-tuk rides, travelers often end up being confronted with vastly overpriced charges. In the event of an accident, remain calm and try to avoid escalations. Be particularly careful when using tuk-tuks and negotiate prices before you travel. If possible, use taxis marked “taxi meter” in the Bangkok city area. When traveling to Preah Vihear (Khao Phra Viharn) and the surrounding temple complexes, follow the travel and safety advice for Cambodia. Please note that if you enter Thailand by scheduled flight, you must also leave by scheduled flight. If you enter the country by charter plane, you must also leave the country by charter flight. A combination of travel routes can lead to rejections/problems with boarding when leaving the country.', ""Driver's license"": 'To drive motor vehicles, either the international driving license, which is only valid in conjunction with the national German driving license, or a Thai driving license are required. An international driving license according to the International Convention on Motor Vehicle Traffic of April 24, 1926 is not sufficient. German national driving licenses alone are not officially recognized in Thailand. A Thai driving license is generally required for stays of more than three months. The conversion of a German driving license into a Thai driving license can be applied for in Thailand. Binding information on how to apply can be obtained from the Department of Land Transport.', 'Special behavioral instructions': 'Thailand is a constitutional monarchy in which the king plays a central role as both head of state and supreme guardian of religion. Criticism of the king, the royal family and the monarchy is generally considered taboo, see legal specifics - lese majeste. Make sure you dress appropriately when entering temples, mosques and churches.', 'LGBTIQ': 'Thailand is known for its tolerance towards the LGBTIQ community. This is particularly true in large cities. Homosexuality is not criminalized. However, same-sex marriages are not yet recognized and there is no legal equality with regard to taxes, adoption, naming rights, etc. Please note the general information for LGBTIQ.', 'Legal specifics': 'Drugs We strongly warn against the purchase, possession, distribution, import and export of all kinds of drugs (including marijuana, ecstasy and other amphetamines). Even the possession of small amounts of drugs leads to long prison sentences; For individual offenses, Thai criminal law provides for the death penalty, which was enforced again for the first time in 2018 after nine years of suspension. Taking or transporting items for third parties without knowing the contents can have disastrous consequences. As of June 2022, certain cannabis products produced in Thailand with a THC content of less than 0.2% will no longer be classified as a drug. However, consumption in public remains illegal. Due to existing restrictions regarding cultivation, consumption and distribution as well as the lack of implementation regulations, caution is still advised. Please check with local authorities. Please note that possession and consumption of even small amounts of all types of drugs is severely punished in several countries in Southeast Asia (sometimes up to the death penalty). This also applies in the transit area of \u200b\u200bthe respective airports. For further information, please refer to the travel and safety information for the respective country. lese majeste The Thai royal family enjoys special respect. Derogatory or critical comments, including on the Internet or on social media, can be punished as lese majeste with prison sentences of up to 15 years per offense. The offense is interpreted broadly. This can also include retweeting or sharing critical posts on social media about the royal family. Theft Theft of items of low value can result in very long prison sentences. Penalty reduction is not granted even if the theft is “compulsive” (kleptomania). Sexual abuse of children The sexual abuse of minors in Thailand is punished harshly and is also prosecuted in Germany if the crime was committed in Thailand. If in doubt, you should make sure about the age of your partner. However, ID cards are often fake. Access restrictions to bars and discos People under 20 are generally prohibited from entering bars, discos and massage parlors. There is a curfew for young people under 18 from 10 p.m. Young people who are found in public without parental supervision after this time risk being arrested. The term ""public"" is interpreted broadly by the authorities and includes not only restaurants but also cinemas. Drinking alcohol in public is prohibited for young people under the age of 18 and will be punished. In general, drinking alcohol inside a moving or parked vehicle is prohibited; this applies to all inmates. Clothing regulations Nude bathing, swimming without a bikini top and sexual acts in public are prohibited and can be punished. Photography ban Apart from military objects, there is generally no ban on photography. When photographing people, however - as everywhere else - a certain tact is required. Drones Violation of the registration requirement for drones can result in a prison sentence of up to five years or a fine of up to 100,000 THB (Baht). Criminal proceedings Criminal proceedings in Thailand are lengthy. The options for defense are limited and often do not correspond to German constitutional expectations. Long pre-trial detention, inadequate, expensive legal representation and harsh prison conditions must be expected. Any conviction for a crime in Thailand (including minor crimes) will result in deportation and an indefinite ban on re-entry after the sentence has been served. Smoking ban/e-cigarettes Smoking is banned on some beaches in Pattaya, Bangsaen, Cha-am, Hua Hin, Phuket, Samui, Phang Nga and Songkhla. Violations of the smoking ban may result in a prison sentence of up to one year and/or a fine of up to THB 100,000. In addition to the import ban, the sale or purchase of e-cigarettes (including IQOS) or other vaporizers is also prohibited and can result in a heavy fine or imprisonment of up to five years.', 'Home ownership': 'Great caution is required when purchasing home ownership, including time-sharing housing rights. In many cases, the services are not provided in the manner guaranteed in the contract. In addition, contrary to the contractual agreement, it is often no longer possible to sell or exchange the residential rights. As a rule, enforcing your own rights fails because the companies concerned disappear from the market after a short time. If necessary, contact the police, even if in many cases they do not investigate to the extent necessary. The tourist police are exclusively responsible for disputes between tourists and Thais. The staff speak English.', 'Money/credit cards': 'The local currency is the baht (THB). Paying with credit cards is widespread. Withdrawals using credit and debit cards are possible at many appropriately marked ATMs. In addition to credit cards, it is still advisable to bring EUR or USD in cash with you. Be careful about counterfeit money in circulation. If possible, only exchange money in authorized exchange offices.'}","{'General information': 'Entry and customs regulations for German citizens can change at short notice without the Foreign Office being informed in advance. Therefore, please inquire in advance with the representatives of your target country. Only there will you receive legally binding information and/or additional information about the entry and customs regulations of your travel country. German customs provides information about the currently applicable customs regulations when entering Germany.', 'Possible entry restrictions/COVID-19': 'Entry regulations change frequently. Please obtain additional information from the official authorities in Thailand and the representative responsible for Germany. Please note the information under COVID-19. Entry and exit Travelers who, following their stay in Thailand, return or continue traveling to a country that requires a negative COVID-19 test result upon entry (including China) must provide proof of health insurance that covers the period when entering Thailand of the planned stay in Thailand plus seven additional days and includes the treatment costs in the event of COVID-19 illness. The responsible Thai diplomatic mission in Germany can provide information on entry questions.', 'Travel documents': ""Entry is possible for German citizens with the following documents: Passport: Yes Temporary passport: Yes Identity card: No Temporary identity card: No Children's passport: Yes Notes: Entry with travel documents that have been reported as lost or stolen is regularly refused in Thailand, even if these documents was returned by domestic German authorities and the corresponding note was deleted from the wanted lists. In these cases, travelers are forced to return home at their own expense. Foreigners are required to always carry their ID cards with them. ID checks are carried out frequently, particularly in the entertainment districts of the capital, but also in Pattaya, Phuket and Chiang Mai. A photocopy of the passport is sufficient, provided that the page with the Thai visa or entry stamp is also copied and carried."", 'A view': 'German citizens generally do not need a visa for tourist stays, which must be obtained before entry. Travelers are required to have a visa if they cannot prove their onward or return journey with a flight ticket, bus or train ticket. The permissible length of stay is determined upon entry by the immigration authorities: when entering the country by both air and land, a maximum stay of 30 days is permitted. A one-time extension of the visa-free stay by a further maximum of 30 days for exclusively tourist purposes is possible. The visa extension must be applied for at the relevant Thai Immigration Bureau before the end of the permitted visa-free stay period. Entry without a visa by land and ship is limited to a maximum of two entries per calendar year. Entry via international airports is not affected by this regulation. Tourist visas obtained from a Thai diplomatic mission before entry generally entitle you to a stay of a maximum of 60 days. Further information on the individual visa types is available (in English) from the Thai immigration authorities. Exceeding the permitted stay Violations of residence regulations are not trivial offenses in Thailand. Travelers who exceed the permitted length of stay (“overstay”) risk arrest and detention pending deportation, severe fines and prison sentences, deportation at their own expense and a ban on re-entry. For “overstays” of up to 40 days, a flat-rate fine of 500 TBH (approx. 13 EUR) per additional day of stay, up to a maximum of 20,000 TBH (approx. 500 EUR), is currently levied. If this cannot be paid, legal proceedings follow, which usually leads to the imposition of a fine or a substitute prison sentence. Even if you are penniless, fines cannot be covered by German public funds. Deportation detention is usually ordered until deportation. The conditions in detention pending deportation are very harsh. Even if you usually only have to state your intended place of stay upon entry, in cases of doubt (e.g. with some backpackers) Thai immigration carries out interviews and also requests more detailed information or even proof of the intended accommodation. If it is discovered upon departure that there is no entry stamp in the passport, an accusation of illegal entry and stay will be made, which can lead to fines and/or prison sentences and deportation. Numerous cases of fraud have been reported in which travelers were sold fake visas. In these cases, travelers have to expect additional criminal proceedings for possessing forged documents. Only apply for visa extension directly to the Thai immigration authorities (Bureau of Immigration), do not use any services from service providers, e.g. B. travel agencies or hotels. In Bangkok, for some visa categories, it is possible to apply for a visa extension online via the service provider VFS. Only enter through official border crossings and make sure to get an entry stamp in your passport.', 'Minors': 'Minors traveling alone must carry an official declaration of consent from their legal guardian(s).

When exporting, amounts of 50,000 THB (approx. 1,300 EUR) or 500,000 THB (approx. 13,000 EUR) or more (only for export to Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia and Vietnam) must be declared. Antiques The export of certain antiques (e.g. Buddha figures or images) is only permitted with the permission of the Fine Arts Department. Further information can be obtained from the Thai embassy in Berlin or the Thai customs authorities. Souvenirs The export of certain leather products (e.g. elephant, crocodile, snake) and ivory as well as their import into Germany are subject to the Washington Convention on Endangered Species / CITES and may therefore be prohibited. It is strongly recommended that you read up on the Washington Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Endangered Species and associated import regulations before purchasing. Cigarettes Cigarettes may only be imported into Thailand up to a maximum of 200 pieces per person. If the maximum limit is exceeded, a fine of ten times the value of the goods can be imposed and the goods can be confiscated. The import of so-called vaporizers, e.g. e-cigarettes (also IQOS), e-Barakus, and accessories into Thailand is prohibited, see legal details - smoking ban/e-cigarettes. Drones The import of drones for private use into Thailand is generally permitted. However, in order to be put into operation in Thailand, the drones must be registered with the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) or the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT).

There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. Malaria occurs all year round in Thailand, depending on the region; around a quarter of the cases are the dangerous malaria tropica. There is a low risk of malaria in the border regions with Myanmar, Cambodia and Malaysia. There is a minimal risk in the rest of the country including Phuket, Koh Samui and other islands. The cities of Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, Pattaya, Samet and the islands of Krabi Province (Koh Phi Phi, Koh Yao Noi, Koh Yao Yai, Ko Lanta) are considered malaria-free, see DTG Standing Committee on Travel Medicine (StAR). To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market.

There is a high risk of malaria all year round throughout the country, including the cities. The proportion of malaria tropica (P. falciparum) is over 99%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body, during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine) are available on the German market.

Fines are usually payable immediately and are duly acknowledged. A special feature of Czech law is the so-called block criminal procedure. Paying the fine in the block procedure means that the person concerned forgoes further legal remedies. It can therefore only be used if he agrees to this procedure to speed up the process.

In the past, some serious terrorist attacks have been carried out in which foreign travelers were also among the victims, such as in 2015 in front of the Bardo Museum in Tunis and on a beach hotel in Sousse. Between 2018 and 2020, there were attacks in a suburb and in the city center of Tunis, most recently on May 9, 2023 on the island of Djerba at the La Ghriba synagogue. The Tunisian security forces are increasing their presence in tourist areas seasonally. The Tunisian Interior Ministry has set up mobile security guards that operate at tourist points, beaches and public places during the summer months. In the mountainous regions near the Algerian border in the area from El Aioun to Kasserine, especially in the mountains of Jebel Chaambi, Jebel Selloum and Jebel Mrhila in Kasserine province, armed clashes with terrorist groups operating there are possible. Some areas there are mined. The security situation is particularly tense in the city and in the region around Ben Guerdane near the Libyan border. Increased military and police presence is expected in these regions. There is an increased risk of kidnapping south or southeast of the line that runs from the border with Algeria via Tozeur/Nafta - Douz - Ksar Ghilane - Tataouine to Zarzis, as well as away from the tourist centers on the edge of the Sahara and especially in border areas. Stay informed via the media and pay attention to information from tour operators. Avoid crowds of people in public places and in front of tourist attractions and mosques or be particularly attentive there. Be particularly careful when traveling to western parts of the country and avoid the mountainous region near the Algerian border in the area from El Aioun to Kasserine. Avoid tourist and other non-essential travel to the area south of the tourist areas of Touzeur/Nafta, Douz, Ksar Ghilane, Tataouine and Zarzis.

In addition, there are repeated spontaneous, localized demonstrations in Tunis and other parts of the country. Violent clashes between demonstrators and security forces cannot be ruled out. Sentiment towards foreigners has also deteriorated recently. There were violent clashes between residents and migrants in Sfax in July 2023. Find out about planned demonstrations and protests on local and social media or from your tour operator. Avoid announced demonstrations and spontaneous, large gatherings of people. Be sure to follow the instructions of the security forces. Always carry your identification documents with you so that you can prove at any time that you are in the country legally. The state of emergency imposed since the end of 2015 with expanded powers for security forces has been regularly extended and has continued to apply nationwide since then. Increased police checks can still be expected across the country. Parts of the southern border area with Algeria and an approximately 20 km wide strip along the entire border with Libya are restricted military areas and therefore inaccessible. These areas can only be entered after obtaining permission from the relevant governorate. The Tunisian-Libyan border crossing at Ras Jedir is temporarily completely closed for entry and exit by land. There may be security-related incidents on the Libyan side. Find out more from the local media or your tour operator and follow the political situation closely.

Pay particular attention to your valuables when visiting old towns and markets (“souks”) as well as at train stations and on public transport. Be especially careful when traveling alone. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Please only take one copy of your travel document with you. Be vigilant when asking for directions and using ATMs. “False guides” and aggressive begging are widespread.

Passport thefts also occur again and again. Foreigners, especially women traveling alone or in small groups, are occasionally affected by violent, including sexual, attacks. In the past, German vacationers to Turkey have been victims of fraud after returning to the federal territory. Using a variety of made-up stories (e.g. lottery winnings, back taxes, impending financial disadvantages), holidaymakers are persuaded by telephone to transfer money to Turkey via an international payment service provider.

It can be assumed that the Turkish law enforcement authorities have extensive lists of people residing in Germany, which are used as a basis for criminal prosecution measures, sometimes with preliminary arrests and subsequent pre-trial detention or exit bans, even without sufficient preliminary investigations. When making arrests and banning people from leaving the country, Turkish law enforcement authorities rely on membership in or support of or propaganda for organizations that are also classified as terrorist organizations in Germany or the EU (IS, PKK), but also on membership in the so-called “Gülen movement”. “, which is only classified as a terrorist organization in Turkey under the name “FETÖ”. Even minor points of contact with these organizations or people or companies associated with them, which the person concerned may not be aware of or only claimed by third parties, can be sufficient for an arrest, even if the points of contact occurred years ago. To justify suspicion of membership in a terrorist organization, it may be sufficient to have been (or have been) registered in a German association register as a board member of an association related to Kurdish concerns, without the association having any connection with the PKK.

This criminal offense can also include statements critical of the government on the internet and social media, be it through sharing, commenting or liking someone else's post, see also information under News. Statements that, according to German legal understanding, are covered by freedom of expression can also lead to criminal prosecution in Turkey and, for example, For journalists, for example, this can lead to career-restricting measures such as the refusal of accreditation.

Exit bans often lead to forced stays in Turkey lasting months or even several years with far-reaching, sometimes life-threatening consequences for the professional, family and health situation of those affected. Taking photos of military installations and members of the security forces or in military security zones is prohibited. In Turkey, drug offenses are punished particularly harshly, 10 to 20 years in prison for importing drugs, six to 12 years for exporting drugs. The acquisition, possession and export of “cultural and natural assets” are also punishable with prison sentences of up to ten years, as these are considered state property. In the event of violations, tourists are also subject to several months of pre-trial detention and high bail payments, e.g. B. EUR 9,000 is common practice, even if it concerns antiques or old-looking items of supposedly low value. In individual cases, prison sentences were imposed. We therefore strongly warn against traders e.g. B. Buy antiques, old coins, fossils, etc. or take them with you yourself. Police and customs authorities interpret the term “antiques” broadly. Any processed stone can be included. Since it is virtually impossible for travelers to determine for themselves whether such an item is protected as an antique, travelers who do not have the appropriate authorization from the relevant Turkish authorities should generally not carry stones, coins, fossils and old-looking items in their luggage attempt. In principle, however, it is possible to obtain an export permit from the museums under the Turkish Ministry of Culture and at some customs offices. The import of weapons and cutting tools, including camping knives, is prohibited without special permission. The general principle is that in Turkey it is punishablewhich is also forbidden in Germany.

This was apparently done in order to check content and contacts for statements and other circumstances that, in the Turkish opinion, could give rise to criminal prosecution (see note on Travel Information: Legal Particulars). Since 2017, German nationals, especially people with close private and personal relationships in Turkey, have been refused entry in numerous cases without being informed of the reasons. Affected people had to begin their journey back to Germany after waiting for several hours to a few days in custody. The background to the refusal of entry is generally not disclosed. It cannot be ruled out that there is a connection to anonymous denunciations. A high proportion of those rejected had a Kurdish or Turkish-Alevi family background. Upon entry, passports are stamped with an entry stamp and date. If possible, inform the responsible German diplomatic mission abroad in the event of detention, an exit ban or rejection upon entry. Do not sign any documents whose contents you do not understand. Insist on legal advice.

To do this, the passport must be valid for 60 days beyond the intended stay. If you plan to stay for more than 90 days before entering the country, you should apply for a corresponding visa at a Turkish diplomatic mission.

Leaving Turkey for Iraq is only possible for holders of a visa valid for Iraq. In this context, please refer to the travel and safety information - partial travel warning - Iraq. Due to the current situation in Syria, we expressly warn against traveling to this country. Reference is made to the Syria travel warning.

However, it is strongly recommended that you carry your passport with you in order to avoid problems when entering the country if you are unaware of the new regulations. Turkish customs will issue a form specifying the latest re-export date. Exceeding this individually set deadline, even by just one day, must be avoided at all costs, otherwise there is a risk of significant fines, which can be many times higher than the value of the vehicle, and criminal proceedings. The deadline is usually 30 days, or up to 90 days upon request. If the owner of the vehicle is not the same as the traveler, the traveler/driver must have a power of attorney from the owner, which should be issued or certified at a Turkish diplomatic mission in Germany.

To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food.

Find out about current air values, for example via the World Air Quality Index and the smartphone app AirVisual.', 'Medical care': ""The medical treatment options in the country's major cities and in the tourist regions have improved significantly in recent years. In particular, the large number of private hospitals offer an almost European standard. Medical care in rural areas is often incomparable to that of Western Europe and can be problematic in terms of technology, equipment and hygiene. Specialists are often only available at the nearest hospital. It should be noted that an existing valid foreign health certificate T/A 11 is often not accepted in practice. Therefore, acceptance should be clarified before treatment. The decision about the scope of services lies with the local service providers, i.e. doctors and hospitals. The insured are often required to make an advance financial contribution. It is common practice in private clinics to request a valid credit card or cash before treatment begins. The prices for treatments in private clinics can be significantly higher than the prices for comparable services in Germany. Therefore, the costs, as well as the type and extent of the treatment, should be discussed in advance as far as possible. There are cases where hospitals take advantage of patients' plight and put pressure on customers. In addition, many hotels in holiday resorts have agreements with certain clinics. Therefore, in individual cases it may make sense to compare prices. It is very important to be thoroughly informed before undergoing treatment abroad and, if necessary, to consult your insurer or other trustworthy sources in order to make an informed decision. This is particularly true in the area of \u200b\u200baesthetic surgery, as different training and hygiene standards sometimes apply here. Claims for recourse are often difficult to enforce abroad. Health insurance companies often do not cover the costs of any necessary corrections. Take out international travel health and repatriation insurance for the duration of your stay abroad. Take an individual first aid kit with you and protect it against high temperatures while on the go. Before you travel, get personal advice from travel medical advice centers, tropical or travel doctors and adjust your vaccination protection. You can find relevant doctors, for example: B. via DTG. If necessary, clarify the expected costs before treatment. If you are chronically ill and can foresee the need for medical treatment before your departure and want to avoid making advance financial payments, you can have your health insurance company issue form T/A 12, which will usually cover the treatment costs. In addition to the general exclusion of liability, please note: No guarantee can be given for the accuracy and completeness of the medical information or liability for any damage that may occur. All information depends on the individual travel conditions and does not replace medical consultation or in-depth medical advice.

Most recently there was an attack on two villages south of Kibale National Park on the night of December 19th and 25th, 2023. In September and October 2023, there were several attacks in the Kasese region and Queen Elizabeth National Park. Two foreign tourists were also killed. There were several attacks in the Kampala region in 2021. Two bomb attacks with fatalities and injuries occurred in the center of Kampala (Nakasero). Please exercise particular caution. Consider being accompanied by people who know the area and find out promptly from local security forces about the current security situation on site. If you are currently in one of the parks, please maintain close contact with security forces. Be particularly careful in busy places such as shopping centers and at events with large gatherings of people, such as: E.g. concerts, church services, sporting events, etc. be very attentive and careful. If you see anything unusual, move away immediately and contact local security forces as soon as possible. Please note the global safety notice.', 'Domestic political situation': 'The domestic political situation has calmed down again after the 2021 elections, but political tensions and sporadic spontaneous rallies as well as harsh intervention by the security forces cannot be ruled out. Unrest in the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Sudan occasionally impacts neighboring areas in Uganda, particularly through influxes of refugees. This is associated with a strong military presence in the border region. Occasional clashes occur in the immediate vicinity of the border, so visiting the Ugandan national parks in this area - especially Semliki National Park, Rwenzori National Park and the southern part of Queen Elizabeth National Park (Ishasha) - can also be dangerous. Always exercise caution and vigilance when traveling within Uganda. Always avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people and move away immediately if you observe arguments in your area. Be sure to follow the instructions of local security forces. Sign up for the crisis preparedness list. Before visiting the Ugandan national parks in the southwest and west, be sure to find out about the current security situation there. If possible, avoid the immediate border area with the Democratic Republic of Congo and heed the partial travel warning there. Be particularly careful in the border area with South Sudan and heed the travel warning in force there. Find out about local media.', 'crime': ""The crime rate is increased. Armed robberies, car thefts and robberies (“carjackings”) and kidnappings are possible throughout the country, including against foreigners. In 2019, an armed robbery and kidnapping occurred against a group of tourists in the southern part of Queen Elizabeth National Park in Ishasha. Robberies on pedestrians committed by motorcycle taxi drivers continue to happen in Kampala. These attacks increasingly also take place during the day. Pedestrians are surprised by the fast-approaching “boda-bodas”, brutally knocked down and robbed, or people try to snatch their handbags or backpacks as they drive past. Injuries are possible. Petty crimes such as pickpocketing, handbag snatching and hotel break-ins also occur regularly. The dangers are particularly great in the dark. Thefts from vehicles can occur when traffic is stopped, such as in traffic jams, at intersections or in slow traffic flows. There is an increased risk of attacks by armed gangs along the border with Kenya in the Karamoja region and when visiting Kidepo National Park near the South Sudanese border. Avoid walking after dark, especially off the main roads in central Kampala. Be particularly careful when walking in Kampala and avoid quiet side streets with less traffic. Do not hold your cell phone in your hand and always carry your bag on the side away from the road. Do not resist if you are robbed. Avoid night driving outside Kampala and the main route to Entebbe. Always keep windows and doors in the hotel and in vehicles closed and locked and do not leave any valuables visible. When traveling to the Karamoja region in the northeast, avoid staying right on the border with Kenya. Please keep as far away as possible from the border with South Sudan and only travel there when accompanied by experienced guides or tour operators. Keep money, ID cards, driver's license and other important documents safe; save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Prefer cashless payments and only take the cash you need for the day and no unnecessary valuables. Never leave drinks and food unattended in restaurants. Be particularly vigilant and look after your valuables in large crowds such as at airports, train stations, markets and especially in the intersection area around the Clock Tower and the Industrial Zone in Kampala. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, offers and requests for help from alleged acquaintances. Do not share any information about yourself, but if necessary, check their credibility personally or contact the police.""}","{'General information': 'Uganda is located in a seismically active zone, which is why earthquakes and volcanic activity can occur.

Please follow the Zika virus infection recommendations for your trip.', 'Rift-Valley-Fieber': 'Rift Valley fever, also known as Rift Valley fever, is endemic to Uganda and is transmitted by diurnal mosquitoes. The disease is usually mild in humans; severe cases involving the eyes, brain and bleeding rarely occur, see Rift Valley fever. Protect yourself from mosquito bites even during the day. If you have a fever or headache, see a doctor and do not use acetylsalicylic acid.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. There is a high risk of malaria all year round throughout the country, including the cities. The proportion of malaria tropica (P. falciparum) is over 99%. The DTG provides a map of the risk areas. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body,\xa0in the evening and at night (malaria). If necessary, sleep under an impregnated mosquito net. Depending on the travel profile, chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) may also be useful in addition to the necessary exposure prophylaxis. Various prescription medications are available for this (e.g. atovaquone-proguanil, doxycycline, mefloquine). Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It is recommended that you take sufficient supplies with you.', 'HIV/AIDS': 'There is generally a high risk of HIV transmission through sexual contact, drug use (unclean syringes or cannulas) and blood transfusions. Always use condoms, especially with casual acquaintances.', 'diarrheal diseases': 'Diarrhea is a common travel illness, see Diarrhea. However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. The indication for a cholera vaccination is only given very rarely, usually only in the case of special exposures such as working in hospitals with cholera patients, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Viral hemorrhagic fevers': 'The hemorrhagic fevers that occur again and again in Uganda include Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) as well as yellow fever, Marburg virus and Ebola virus infections. A characteristic of these viral infections is high fever, a pronounced feeling of illness and a tendency to bleed. The diseases are associated with a high death rate. Yellow fever is transmitted by diurnal mosquitoes, CCHF, through the bite of infected ticks and through contact with the blood and flesh of infected animals. Marburg and Ebola infections occur in connection with contact with bats or animals and meat from infected animals (bush meat). Infections have been reported after visiting bat caves in Fort Portal in western Uganda, as well as the “Python” cave in the Maramagambo Forest, which is part of the Queen Elizabeth National Park in the south of the country. For all hemorrhagic fevers (except yellow fever), unprotected contact with sick people, especially their body fluids, poses a high risk. Get vaccinated against yellow fever. Avoid bat caves and other gatherings of these animals. Avoid contact with raw game meat, especially from monkeys (“bush meat”). Avoid slaughterhouses or other animal slaughterhouses and contact with animal blood. Use skin repellents against mosquitoes and ticks, even during the day. Stay away from hospitals and avoid sick people and their body fluids.', 'Schistosomiasis (Bilharziose)': 'Schistosomiasis is transmitted during bathing, wading or other leisure activities in or near freshwater through the penetration of the worm larvae through the intact skin, see also Schistosomiasis. Avoid swimming in freshwater waters.', 'African tick bite fever': 'After malaria, the most common febrile infectious disease caused by a stay in African national parks is African tick-bite fever. The pathogen, Rickettsia africae, is transmitted by ticks that are sometimes very aggressive when they are unprotected in grass and savanna landscapes. The disease is characterized by fever, headache and body aches and later by a skin rash (exanthema). The blood-encrusted puncture site (Eschar), which is often not noticed at first, is characteristic. Doxycycline for treatment is very effective. Protect yourself with appropriate clothing, insect repellent and body checks for ticks upon return.', 'Sleeping sickness (African trypanosomiasis)': ""In the country's national parks, especially Murchison-Falls National Park, an infection with the sleeping sickness pathogen can occur, which can be transmitted through large diurnal flies (TseTse) with a painful bite, even through thin fabric.

The export of antiques (older than 75 years) is prohibited. It is mandatory and highly recommended to list medications precisely in the customs declaration that every traveler must present upon entry and exit (see also Medical Information). The import declaration stamped by Uzbek customs is important as proof of legal import. It happens that Uzbek authorities (e.g. at border controls when leaving the country) stop travelers because they are carrying medication that is considered a drug in Uzbekistan (per se or above a certain amount) and was not declared upon import.

Airlines require passengers to check-in at least four hours before their scheduled departure. It occasionally happens that international flights of Venezuelan airlines are canceled at short notice due to unpaid liabilities. The network of domestic flights has been thinned out. Technical problems are occasionally reported on Venezuelan domestic flights and on flights with small private aircraft used, among other things, to transport tourists. The aircraft used are often older machines and are difficult to maintain. Avior's aircraft are currently on the EU's list of unsafe airlines. Venezuela does not have a strong tourist infrastructure and road traffic is dangerous in places. Adequate treatment for accident victims is no longer guaranteed due to the medical care shortage. During the rainy season, road connections are regularly disrupted due to landslides or washouts. The road connections over the Andes are particularly affected, such as the land connection to Colombia and the pass routes to popular holiday areas such as Merida and Choroní.

Local currency is hardly available anymore, so money cannot usually be exchanged and issuance at ATMs has been stopped. Payment transactions are largely carried out electronically and are usually also possible with international credit cards. The USD has become established as a means of payment in many shops, hotels and restaurants, which is why you should carry enough cash in the smallest possible bills (there is no change), although the exchange rate compared to the Bolívar changes almost daily.

Dengue viruses are transmitted nationwide by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is usually accompanied by fever, rash and severe body aches and is increasingly affecting travelers. In rare cases, serious complications and possible death occur, especially in children. Overall, however, complications among travelers are rare. Chemoprophylaxis and specific therapy do not exist. A vaccination is available, see dengue fever. Get advice from tropical and/or travel doctors regarding vaccination. To avoid dengue fever, protect yourself consistently from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Vaccination protection': ""No compulsory vaccinations are required when entering directly from Germany, but a yellow fever vaccination is strongly recommended when traveling to almost all parts of the country except central sections of the north coast. In 2021, seven yellow fever infections occurred in people south of the municipality of Maturín in northeastern Venezuela (Monagas state). When entering from an area where yellow fever is endemic, such as neighboring countries, proof of a yellow fever vaccination is required from everyone aged one year and over. This also applies if you are in transit for more than 12 hours (e.g. in Brazil). Make sure that you and your children's standard vaccinations are up to date according to the Robert Koch Institute's vaccination calendar.

Please follow the recommendations for your trip, see Zika virus infection.', 'Chikungunya fever': 'Chikungunya viruses are transmitted by diurnal Aedes mosquitoes. The disease is characterized by high fever and possibly prolonged joint and muscle pain. The symptoms often cannot be clearly distinguished from other mosquito-borne diseases. Chikungunya fever does not always heal without consequences; long-lasting rheumatism-like symptoms rarely occur. There is neither a vaccination or chemoprophylaxis nor a specific therapy, see Chikungunya fever. To avoid chikungunya fever, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially during the day, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Malaria': 'Malaria is transmitted by crepuscular and nocturnal Anopheles mosquitoes. If left untreated, the dangerous malaria tropica in particular is often fatal in non-immune Europeans. The disease can break out weeks to months after staying in the risk area, see Malaria. If you develop a fever during or even months after a trip, see a doctor as quickly as possible and inform them that you are in a malaria area. A high risk exists all year round in the region south of the Orinoco and in a strip north along the Orinoco, including the delta in the state of Delta Amacuro. Low risk in regions north of it, including Caracas and Isla Margarita. The main pathogen is Plasmodium vivax (77%), which causes malaria tertiana. In addition, malaria tropica (23%) occurs in varying frequencies. See also the current distribution maps of the Standing Committee on Travel Medicine (StAR) of the DTG. The need for chemoprophylaxis (taking tablets) depends on your travel profile. Discuss the selection of medications and their personal adjustment as well as side effects or intolerances with other medications with a tropical medicine or travel medicine specialist before taking them. It may be recommended to take sufficient supplies with you. To avoid malaria, consistently protect yourself from insect bites as part of exposure prophylaxis. You should pay particular attention to the following points: Wear light-colored clothing that covers your body (long pants, long shirts). Repeatedly apply insect repellent to all exposed areas of the body during the day (dengue) and in the evening and at night (malaria).

However, most diarrheal diseases and cholera (see below) can be avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. To protect your health, please note the following basic instructions: Only drink water of safe origin, never tap water. Purchasing carbonated bottled water makes it easier to identify a previously opened bottle. If possible, use drinking water to wash dishes and brush your teeth when you are out and about. If bottled water is not available, use filtered, disinfected or boiled water. Cook or peel food yourself. Be sure to keep flies away from your food. Wash your hands with soap as often as possible, but always before preparing food and before eating. If possible, disinfect your hands with liquid disinfectant.', 'Cholera': 'Cholera is transmitted through inadequately treated drinking water or raw food and can therefore be easily avoided through appropriate food and drinking water hygiene. Only a small proportion of people infected with cholera become ill, and of these the majority have a comparatively mild course. There is no indication for a cholera vaccination for most travelers, see Cholera. If necessary, seek advice from a tropical or travel doctor regarding your risk profile.', 'Leishmaniasis': 'In rural regions, both skin/mucous membrane leishmaniasis and, rarely, organ leishmaniasis occur. The parasites are transmitted by small sand flies that are active at dusk and at night and prefer to stay in moist and shady habitats. In the case of insect bites that heal poorly or, for example, a persistent, unexplained fever, both diseases should be ruled out. To avoid leishmaniases, consistently protect yourself from mosquito bites, especially in the evening and at night, as part of exposure prophylaxis.', 'Trypanosomiasis („Chagas disease“)': 'In rural areas, transmission of Chagas disease can occur in very simple accommodation. The risk for travelers is very low. Transmission occurs through predatory bugs whose infected feces get into the bite wound or, rarely, through the oral ingestion of contaminated fruit or sugar cane juices. In the acute phase of the disease, flu-like symptoms and up to 50% swelling of the eyelid occur. Years after the infection, serious organ changes can occur. Protect yourself from nocturnal predatory bug bites in simple accommodation in the countryside through exposure prophylaxis, particularly through correctly installed bed nets.', 'Medical care': 'The public health system in Venezuela is no longer able to adequately care for the sick or carry out necessary operations. In the private sector, good medical care is available in many areas in the capital Caracas. In Caracas, common medications are available in many pharmacies.

Open or disputed claims from previous business relationships in the UAE can, even after a long time, lead to temporary arrest upon entry or transit in order to settle old debts. Legal disputes and outstanding claims can lead to the imposition of a “travel ban”, meaning that the person concerned cannot leave the UAE for several months. Exit bans can also be imposed after showing offensive gestures or verbal arguments. Filing a report with the police can also result in the person making the report being banned from leaving the country. This is usually only lifted when the matter has been clarified from the point of view of the Emirati authorities or the complaint has been withdrawn. Particular attention is drawn to comprehensive video surveillance in public spaces. Exit is not possible while the Emirati residence permit is being reissued (“residency visa”).

Criminal law is shaped by Islamic moral concepts. Prostitution is a criminal offense. The exchange of affection in public and so-called “cross-dressing” are prohibited and can also result in criminal penalties if reported. Since November 2020, cohabitation between unmarried people of different sexes is no longer a criminal offense in the UAE. However, pregnancies outside of marriage, if they become known to official authorities (e.g. during medical treatment or when reported), can also lead to criminal prosecution of the mother and also the biological father. Single pregnant women, even those about to get married, should be aware of these risks before traveling to the UAE. However, the recognition of the child by the father and the subsequent registration of the child result in impunity.

There is also an increased risk of bush and forest fires in other states, especially in the south and southwest of the USA. Pay attention to media reports and advice from local authorities regarding bush and forest fires. Get updated information from the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection and air quality in affected areas via AirNow . Check with FEMA about current disruptions or use the FEMA app, which not only shows current alerts but also shows the nearest emergency shelters. Cold and blizzards Extreme cold can occur in the winter months, particularly in the Midwest and northern United States. Snowstorms occur frequently on the east coast, severely impacting public life. Be prepared for significant traffic disruptions, including restrictions on air traffic, and contact the Federal Aviation Administration, for example. Pay attention to reports in the media and information from local authorities, e.g. the FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) or use the FEMA app, which not only shows current alarm messages but also shows the nearest emergency shelters. Earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis Parts of the USA are located in very seismically active zones in which there is an increased risk of earthquakes and sometimes also tsunamis, such as in Alaska, California, Nevada, Oklahoma, Oregon, Washington, American Samoa, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and the Northern Mariana Islands. Most recently, there was an earthquake of magnitude 6.4 on the northern coast of California in 2022. There were several earthquakes of magnitude 6.4 in southwestern Puerto Rico in late 2019 and early 2020. There were some fatalities and injuries. There was sometimes significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. Find out more before traveling to the affected areas. Be extra careful there. Avoid damaged buildings, bridges and roads. There are numerous active volcanoes in the USA, including in Alaska, Hawaii and the Northern Mariana Islands, but also in the states of Washington (Mount St. Helens) and Oregon (Mount Hood). In 2022, earthquakes and eruptions from the Mauna Loa volcano occurred in Hawaii in the southeast of the Big Island; Kilauea volcano became active again in 2023. After or during volcanic eruptions, roads are repeatedly closed due to escaping lava. Be particularly careful when visiting volcanoes and do not undertake them without a local guide. Do not enter restricted zones. Current information on warning levels is available from the U.S. Volcanoes and Current Activity Alerts. Familiarize yourself with what to do during earthquakes, volcanoes and tsunamis. These are provided by the information sheets from the German Research Center for Geosciences and the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program. Check with FEMA about current disruptions or use the FEMA app, which not only shows current alerts but also shows the nearest emergency shelters. Algae In parts of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, increased concentrations of red algae can occur seasonally. The water bloom can lead to respiratory complications and also causes massive fish deaths in many places. Bathing is possible, but depending on the amount of water, it can be affected by skin irritation, odors and coughing. If necessary, check with the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission for the current situation and currently affected beaches. If necessary, please note the basic information from the National Ocean Service. Always follow the advice of local authorities.'}","{'Infrastructure/transport': ""Public transport The national bus, train and scheduled flight network is well developed. There are also subways and other means of local transport in major cities. Find out whether local transport is safe to use at night. Participation in road traffic The rules of road traffic can vary from state to state. Before you travel, find out about the traffic regulations, which sometimes differ from the German regulations. Some examples: In many states, turning right at red lights is permitted as long as the car is stopped and no other person is endangered. However, it may be prohibited in individual cases and will then be signposted accordingly, e.g. “No turn on red”. When all-way stop signs are posted at intersections, all vehicles must stop at the stop line and then enter the intersection in the order in which they stopped. Unlike in Germany, overtaking on the right is permitted in most states in the USA. You are not allowed to drive past stopped school buses with their hazard lights on, even from the opposite direction. Obey US speed limits. These are lower than in Germany. Exceeding the speed limit or drunk driving can result in high fines or even imprisonment. If you are stopped by the police, remain seated in the vehicle, open the window, keep your hands on the steering wheel and follow the officer's instructions. Do not leave without being asked, as this could be perceived as a threat and lead to countermeasures. Do not use cell phones without a hands-free system while driving. This behavior is illegal in many states and is punishable by heavy fines. Traffic routes subject to tolls Important highways (e.g. turnpikes operated by private companies) as well as bridges or tunnels are often subject to tolls. The toll fee (so-called toll) can be paid at toll stations in cash or, in some cases, with digital payment options. Find out in advance about any toll fees and payment options that may apply, e.g. from your rental car company. Traffic tickets Traffic tickets (so-called tickets) for incorrect parking, excessive speed, etc. must be paid, if possible before you leave the country. Failure to pay may result in inconveniences during future entries and stays. Even after you leave the USA, the office that issued the ticket is responsible for providing information. The German diplomatic missions in the USA cannot help with problems with traffic tickets issued in the USA. Pay your traffic tickets before you leave the USA. Rental vehicles and vehicle insurance The minimum age when renting is usually 25 years. Check with the car rental company in advance whether an international driving license needs to be presented. Companies are obliged to inform tourists about possible dangers and, for example, to provide brochures on rules of conduct in traffic. Rental cars usually have liability insurance up to a certain amount of damage. Any claims for punitive damages (so-called punitive damages) cannot be insured. This involves very large amounts of money. In the USA, enforcement and coercive measures resulting from such a judgment are always possible - even during possible future stays in the USA."", ""Driver's license"": ""In some U.S. states, an international driver's license - in conjunction with the mandatory national driver's license - is mandatory. It is also advisable to carry an international driving license with you (e.g. also in connection with renting a car). Information about the driving license regulations of each U.S. state can be found on the websites of the respective Departments of Transportation. As a driver, carry both your national and international driving license with you."", 'Travel\xa0to Cuba': 'Tourist travel directly between the United States and Cuba is prohibited under U.S. law.

For example, those EU citizens who have secured their residence or their previous rights as EU citizens in the United Kingdom through a so-called pre-settled or settled status (British proof of residence) can continue to cross the border with an identity card. If the identity card (and not the passport) is used when crossing the border in these cases, it is recommended that the identity card and digital proof of residence status are linked in order to simplify data comparison by the British Border Police.

The background was critical statements about Vietnam/Vietnamese politics on social media, partly also from those affected. The responsible German missions abroad were not informed by the Vietnamese authorities. There are military restricted areas that are not always marked as such, or only have signs in Vietnamese, as well as the immediate border area, which is also not always adequately marked. Its extent or the distance from the actual border is often interpreted arbitrarily by the local security authorities. If you intend to visit near the border, you must carry separate permits from the Ministry of Public Security. Areas can also be declared “restricted areas” at short notice. Avoid demonstrations and large gatherings of people. Follow the instructions of local security forces. Be aware that statements made on social media in Germany will be noticed in Vietnam and can lead to consequences (police interrogations, refusal or delay in leaving the country) if you travel to Vietnam.

However, an increase in petty crime such as theft, particularly in tourist areas, has been observed. At Hanoi train station, tourists were often robbed, especially those arriving on the night train from Hue or Sapa. There is also an increase in theft of cash from hotel rooms, even from ""better"" hotels. Women traveling alone are at risk of sexual harassment and assault. In Hanoi, especially at Hoan Kiem Lake, there are always attempts at fraud. In some cases, street vendors charge “fees” for taking photographs; in other cases, tourists’ shoes are soiled or smeared with glue, confiscated and a “return fee” is charged. Cases of credit card fraud have been reported in which cards were copied and debits made. In Ho Chi Minh City, Nha Trang and Hanoi, handbag and luggage theft are increasing, both from passing mopeds and after diversionary maneuvers by gangs of children, especially upon arrival and departure in front of the hotel. In Ho Chi Minh City, foreign tourists are increasingly being approached under various pretexts - for example with references to an encounter at the airport or to close relatives who will soon be studying or working in Europe - and invited to private homes. After creating a hospitable and sociable atmosphere, the victim is then involved in fictitious card or gambling games, at the end of which the victim loses and is threatened into paying alleged gambling debts. It is not ruled out that food or drinks may be laced with drugs. If a theft occurs, neither the immigration police in Hanoi nor other police departments subsequently record reports of loss. In the past, the police have repeatedly refused to record reports, especially when there were doubts about the course of the crime or the value information. Be particularly attentive in large crowds such as at airports and train stations and look after your valuables. Keep money, ID cards, driving licenses and other important documents safe (e.g. in a safe); save electronic copies/photos if necessary. This makes it easier to issue a replacement document in the event of theft or loss. Avoid bicycle taxis (Cyclos) or motorcycle taxis (Xe Om) after dark. Ask permission before taking photos of street vendors. If necessary, reject offers in a loud voice as a deterrent effect and stay away from shoe shiners if possible. Isolated cases of the use of knockout drops in bars or clubs frequented by tourists and subsequent sexual assaults have been reported. Therefore, do not leave your drinks and food unattended - especially in bars or clubs. If travel documents, cash or other valuables go missing, report the loss immediately to the police at the scene. Be skeptical of unusual emails, phone calls, prize announcements, private invitations and requests for help from alleged acquaintances.

In the provinces of central Vietnam and the Mekong Delta, but also in some provinces in southern Vietnam, typhoons can occur, especially between June and November, which can cause widespread flooding, landslides and damage to infrastructure.

Roads in rural areas are often not in good condition. In mountainous areas they can become impassable due to sudden landslides. Road traffic poses a serious threat. The number of traffic fatalities is one of the highest in an international comparison, and the risk of falling victim to an accident is many times higher than in Germany. Most accidents happen after dark. The helmet requirement for moped drivers that has now been introduced has not changed anything, the reason being an often reckless driving style and the increasing number of road users, especially cars. Since last year, there have been several serious, sometimes fatal, motorcycle accidents involving foreign travelers on country roads in the provinces, especially in Ha Giang Province, which is popular with tourists. Medical care outside metropolitan areas is inadequate and there is no emergency medical care. Exercise the greatest possible caution in road traffic and, if possible, avoid renting individual cars or mopeds during your vacation. Please note that the strict alcohol limit of 0 per mille applies to all road users (including cyclists). Please note that driving motorcycles or scooters with a displacement of more than 50 cc is not permitted with a class B driving license. Wear appropriate protective clothing and drive with foresight. Be careful when renting and do not leave your passport as security. The theft rate of two-wheelers is very high. Never leave your moped/scooter unattended. The advertised taxi fares are not per person, but per trip. Taxi drivers who did not belong to a company known to be reliable often manipulated the taximeter and demanded the unjustified high fare at the end of the journey, threatening violence. In Ho Chi Minh City, taxi fraud is increasingly occurring at the airport's official taxi rank. Some taxi drivers refuse to turn on the meter and charge imaginary amounts. In such a case, upon arrival at the hotel, ask the hotel staff for assistance before paying. At the airport, only use official taxis and generally only providers that are considered reliable. So-called intermediaries sell various transport services (buses, trains, taxis, etc.) at completely inflated prices. Tickets have often turned out to be fakes; The transport was then refused or a second ticket purchase was necessary. Only purchase tickets at official sales points. In recent years there have been repeated shipping accidents in Ha Long Bay, some of which have resulted in fatalities.
